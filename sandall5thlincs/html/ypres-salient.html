      <h2>The Ypres Salient</h2>
      
      <p>From <span title="1915-06-23">June 23rd</span> to the <span title="1915-06-29">29th</span> we remained at <a id="place138">Ouderdom</a>
         bivouacking in the open in a field close to the village; fortunately the weather
         was fine. For the first two days the Battalion rested, being occupied with
         interior economy, on the <span title="1915-06-25">25th</span> and <span title="1915-06-26">26th</span> route marches, of about seven miles, were
         undertaken; for the next three days two Companies were detailed each day for
         digging on second line trenches, while the other two Companies had short route
         marches. On <span title="1915-06-28">June 28th</span> our "First
         Reinforcement", left at <a id="place139" href="place-index.html?n=Stansted, Essex, England" title="Stansted, Essex, England">Stansted</a> on our departure from England, together with a draft from
         the Base composed of men who had gone sick, and had now been discharged from
         hospital, joined the Battalion. The welcome draft, consisting of an Officer,
         <a href="people-index.html#Walcott, Lyons George Edmund, Lt (d 1916)" title="Walcott, Lyons George Edmund, Lt (d 1916)" id="pers102">Lieut.
            G. Walcott</a>,
         and about 100 other ranks, brought us once again up to war establishment, or
         very nearly. The draft were met on the road from <a id="place140" href="place-index.html?n=Poperinge, Belgium" title="Poperinge, Belgium">Poperinghe</a>, where they had detrained, by the band, and played
         to our bivouac, where they were received with much enthusiasm by the Battalion.

            Stephenson</a>, who went on leave to England on the
         <span title="1915-06-24">24th</span>, was to the great loss of the Battalion
         unfit to return owing to illness, and his duties as 2nd-in-Command were taken
         over by <a href="people-index.html#Robinson, Harry Ingram, Maj (d 1915)" title="Robinson, Harry Ingram, Maj (d 1915)" id="pers104">Major
            H. I.
            Robinson</a>, who filled the position with
         conspicuous success.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1915-06-29">June 29th</span> we paraded at 7 p.m. for the seven
         mile march to the trenches to be taken over from the 8th Sherwood Foresters in
         the wooded district 
         [<a id="p33" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/33/mode/1up">p33</a>]
          south of <a id="place141">Hooge</a>, almost at the apex of the <a id="place142" href="place-index.html?n=Ieper, Belgium" title="Ieper, Belgium">Ypres</a> Salient. The night was dark and wet, and
         consequently the relief took some time, but was finally completed by 1.30 a.m.
         on <span title="1915-06-30">June 30th</span>. In the afternoon of the same day
         the Battalion was redistributed and further trenches taken over from the 4th
         Royal Fusiliers, and the 1st Battalion of our own Regiment, these trenches being
         situated in the <abbr title="South-West">S.W.</abbr> corner of Sanctuary Wood, with sheltered communications, which
         rendered a daylight relief possible. Battalion Headquarters were in Sanctuary
         Wood, and consisted only of a bomb-proof shelter, constantly exposed to shell
         fire, and were moved <span title="1915-07-01">next day</span> to a more sheltered
         spot in the wood, after one shell had exploded in the Headquarters' Mess Box,
         which was placed just outside the door of the shelter, scattering its contents
         in all directions; the Battalion staff showed no hesitation in complying with
         the Brigade order to move. The distribution of Companies was also altered, one
         Company being brought back to the new Battalion Headquarters in support, while
         three Companies held the trench line. The only disadvantage of the position in
         Sanctuary Wood was that no cooking was allowed by daylight; smoke at any point
         invariably attracted shell fire to the spot. The most noticeable features in the
         trench sector we now held were the comparative absence of rifle fire, with the
         exception of long range machine gun fire at night, and the great increase in
         artillery activity. In the <a id="place143" href="place-index.html?n=Kemmel, Heuvelland, Belgium" title="Kemmel, Heuvelland, Belgium">Kemmel</a>
         sector nearly all our casualties had been caused by rifle fire, in the Salient
         our casualties in the trenches were practically all due to shell fire, those due
         to rifle or machine-gun fire being sustained during reliefs when the troops were
         in the open, and often a mile behind the front line. During this first tour in
         the new sector, <a href="people-index.html#Binns, Arthur Lennon, Capt" title="Binns, Arthur Lennon, Capt" id="pers105">
            2nd Lieut.
            Binns
            </a> who had been doing excellent work 
         [<a id="p34" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/34/mode/1up">p34</a>]
         
         as Bombing Officer, was severely wounded; the weather was fine and warm and no
         special incident occurred; the usual strengthening and improving of trenches was
         carried on, together with the never ending repair of damage to the parapets
         caused by constant shell fire.</p>
      
      <p>On account of the long march necessary to reach our rest billets, it was decided
         that the tour of each Battalion in the trenches should be extended to six days,
         instead of four as formerly, and except on emergency this routine was continued
         for the future. Our relief was therefore fixed for the evening of <span title="1915-07-05">July 5th</span>, and was completed at 1.15 a.m. on <span title="1915-07-06">July 6th</span> by the 1/5th North Staffordshire Regiment,
         the Battalion marching back to rest in "E" Huts on the

         <a id="place146">Ouderdom</a>.</p>
      
      <p>During the next six day's rest, each Company carried out training independently
         when not detailed, which was more often the case, for constructional work on
         second line trenches at Kruisstraat or
         on cable trenches near <a id="place148" href="place-index.html?n=Ieper, Belgium" title="Ieper, Belgium">Ypres</a>. On <span title="1915-07-09">July 9th</span>

      <p>Owing to redistribution of the Divisional front the Battalion did not return to
         the Sanctuary Wood trenches, but on <span title="1915-07-12">July 12th</span>
         relieved the 1st Cheshire Regiment in a sector in the <abbr title="South-East">S.E.</abbr> face of the Salient, two Companies holding the line with two Companies
         in support in dug-outs at the <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> end of <a id="place149" href="place-index.html?n=Zillebeke, Ieper, Belgium" title="Zillebeke, Ieper, Belgium">Zillebeke</a> Lake, where
         Battalion Headquarters were situated. On <span title="1915-07-14">July 14th</span>
         <a href="people-index.html#Ingoldby, Frederick John Willow, Maj" title="Ingoldby, Frederick John Willow, Maj" id="pers108">Captain
            F. J.
            M.
            Ingoldby</a> was seriously wounded while endeavouring
         to locate a sniper, who was annoying his trench. The weather now broke, and a
         few days' heavy rain necessitated 
         [<a id="p35" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/35/mode/1up">p35</a>]
          much hard
         work on repair and drainage of trenches and communication trenches. On <span title="1915-07-18">July 18th</span> yet another redistribution of front took
         place, the Battalion frontage being prolonged to the left, and all four
         Companies being brought up to the front line, with Battalion Headquarters in
         dug-outs in a bank about 100 yards behind. At 11 p.m. on <span title="1915-07-19">July 19th</span> the Battalion was relieved by 1/4th Leicester Regiment and
         returned to the dug-outs at the end of <a id="place150" href="place-index.html?n=Zillebeke, Ieper, Belgium" title="Zillebeke, Ieper, Belgium">Zillebeke</a> Lake, as Brigade support, the Brigade front being now
         held with two Battalions in the line, one in support at <a id="place151" href="place-index.html?n=Zillebeke, Ieper, Belgium" title="Zillebeke, Ieper, Belgium">Zillebeke</a> Lake and one in reserve. While the
         Battalion was in Brigade support large working parties were detailed daily for
         constructional work on second line trenches, and the remainder were occupied in
         making new dug-outs in the bank at the <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> end of the Lake, where the accommodation, which was ample for two
         Companies, was totally insufficient for the whole Battalion. The great objection
         to the Lake bank as a place of residence was the fact that the enemy artillery
         had the range exactly and shelled continually, but fortunately the bank was very
         narrow and shells fell either harmlessly in the lake itself, or on the marshy
         ground on the other side, and did little damage; a direct hit on the bank was
         very rare, though a considerable number of casualties were caused by splinters.
         On the night of <span title="1915-07-24">July 24th</span> the enemy exploded a
         mine immediately in front of the parapet of Trench 50, held by the 1/5th
         Leicestershire Regiment, adjoining the left of our sector, causing some 50
         casualties, and a half Company of the Battalion was sent up as support to the
         1/4th Leicester Regiment in case of emergency, but were not required, as the
         enemy did not attempt to occupy the crater.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1915-07-25">July 25th</span> we returned to the front line,
         relieving the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment in trenches 
         [<a id="p36" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/36/mode/1up">p36</a>]
          42 to 49. The sector now occupied consisted of a trench line,
         of which the left portion was on high ground in front of Armagh Wood, the centre
         crossed a dip in front of Square Wood, while the right sloped up to the rising
         ground towards the <a id="place152" href="place-index.html?n=Ieper, Belgium" title="Ieper, Belgium">Ypres</a>-<a id="place153" href="place-index.html?n=Comines, Belgium" title="Comines, Belgium">Comines</a> railway; the breadth of No Man's Land
         varied from 200 yards to 25 yards. During this tour we experienced for the first
         time a bombardment with heavy trench mortars (Minenwerfer), popularly known as
         "Minnies", which caused great damage to trenches, but the toll
         of casualties was light. The work done was chiefly improving trenches and
         especially the wire in front; while engaged in superintending the latter in
         front of one of the machine gun emplacements, <a href="people-index.html#Templeman, Francis James, 21 (d 1915)" title="Templeman, Francis James, 21 (d 1915)" id="pers109">
            Sergeant
            Templeman</a>, the Battalion Machine Gun Sergeant, who had done excellent work
         since mobilization, was killed. In addition to heavy trench mortars, we were
         also frequently worried by small trench mortar bombs, popularly known as
         "Sausages" from their shape. Their flight was slow, and could
         be easily observed, and the garrisons of trenches exposed to them usually posted
         a sentry, known as the "sausage look-out", furnished with a
         whistle, whose duty was to blow his whistle as a signal to take cover, whenever
         he observed a bomb in flight.</p>
      
      <p>We were rather heavily shelled during the afternoon of <span title="1915-07-30">July 30th</span>, when the Germans made an attack on <a id="place154">Hooge</a>, held by the Division on our left.
         Beyond this the operation did not affect the Battalion, although the 139th
         Brigade, who were holding the left of the Divisional sector, were involved, and
         on the <span title="1915-07-30">30th</span> were seriously attacked, but owing to
         their gallant defence, we were not called upon to assist.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1915-08-01">August 1st</span> we were relieved in trenches by the
         1/4th Leicestershire Regiment and for two days occupied the railway dug-outs,
         situated in the 
         [<a id="p37" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/37/mode/1up">p37</a>]
         
         <a id="place155" href="place-index.html?n=Ieper, Belgium" title="Ieper, Belgium">Ypres</a>-<a id="place156" href="place-index.html?n=Comines, Belgium" title="Comines, Belgium">Comines</a> Railway embankment, near the dug-outs in the <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> bank of <a id="place157" href="place-index.html?n=Zillebeke, Ieper, Belgium" title="Zillebeke, Ieper, Belgium">Zillebeke</a> Lake,
         providing each day large working parties for second line trenches. Having been
         24 days in the front line and support however, and having been rather heavily
         shelled for the greater part of the time, the Battalion was quite ready for the
         short rest which ensued for the next week. At dusk on <span title="1915-08-03">August 3rd</span>, the Battalion left the railway dug-outs and marched by
         Platoons into <a id="place158" href="place-index.html?n=Ieper, Belgium" title="Ieper, Belgium">Ypres</a>, finding their way
         in the darkness with some difficulty to the Infantry Barracks in the middle of
         the city, where we were billeted for the night. This was the only occasion
         during our tour in the Salient, when the Battalion actually entered <a id="place159" href="place-index.html?n=Ieper, Belgium" title="Ieper, Belgium">Ypres</a> itself, and on the afternoon of the
         <span title="1915-08-04">4th</span>, we left the City and marched by Platoons
         to our former quarters when in Divisional Reserve at the E huts at <a id="place160">Ouderdom</a>, where a quiet evening out of shell
         fire, with the band playing, was much enjoyed by all. We were allowed two days
         complete rest, and on the third day, <span title="1915-08-07">August 7th</span>,
         only provided working parties for the construction of new dug-outs at Kruisstraat,
         while <span title="1915-08-08">Sunday, the 8th</span>, was also a rest day, and a Battalion Church Parade
         was the only duty.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1915-08-09">August 9th</span>, we received orders to stand by,
         ready to move at short notice, if required, to support the 6th Division, who on
         this day made a successful counter attack on the <a id="place162">Hooge</a> trenches, captured by the Germans on <span title="1915-07-29">July 29th</span>, but we were not called upon; we were
         also due to relieve the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment in trenches the same
         evening, but the orders for the relief were cancelled owing to heavy shelling
         along the front, so we enjoyed an extra day's rest. On the night of <span title="1915-08-10">August 10th</span>, however, we again took over the trench
         line, 2nd Lieuts. <a href="people-index.html#Mountain, Hugh Denzil, Capt" title="Mountain, Hugh Denzil, Capt" id="pers110">

      <p>This tour in trenches was somewhat uneventful, with the usual shelling at
         intervals, Battalion Headquarters being rather heavily shelled on the <span title="1915-08-15">15th</span>; in consequence work on a deep shelter tunnel
         was begun in the bank behind which Battalion Headquarters were situated, for use
         in case of emergency. The work on the improvement of trenches was continued,
         bomb stores were constructed in each trench, and rifle batteries were
         constructed and laid on enemy communication trenches, which were thus kept
         continually under long range rifle fire at night. On the <span title="1915-08-12">12th</span>

      <p>On <span title="1915-08-16">August 16th</span>, we were relieved in trenches by
         1/4th Leicestershire Regiment, as usual, and became Brigade Reserve, one half
         the Battalion, with Headquarters, returning to the railway dug-outs near
         <a id="place163" href="place-index.html?n=Zillebeke, Ieper, Belgium" title="Zillebeke, Ieper, Belgium">Zillebeke</a> Lake, the other half

         Battalion at <a id="place164" href="place-index.html?n=Zillebeke, Ieper, Belgium" title="Zillebeke, Ieper, Belgium">Zillebeke</a> provided the
         usual working parties, while the other half were employed in constructing

      <p>On <span title="1915-08-22">August 22nd</span> we returned to trenches, taking

            </a> joined from the Divisional Rest Station and resumed command of the
         Machine Gun Section. No particular event of importance occurred during the tour
         except the discovery of an enemy mine at the junction of 40 
         [<a id="p39" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/39/mode/1up">p39</a>]
          and 41 trenches on the right of the Battalion sector. A
         counter mine was sunk by our <abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr> tunnelling Company, the trenches cleared, the German mine exploded,
         and our trenches re-constructed without any interference by the enemy. We were
         relieved on the <span title="1915-08-25">25th</span> at 10 p.m. by the 1/4th
         Leicestershire Regiment, and marched back to E huts at <a id="place165">Ouderdom</a>, the last Company arriving there at 4
         a.m. on the <span title="1915-08-29">29th</span>. To the great delight of the
         Machine Gun Section our old .303 Converted Machine Guns were now exchanged for
         six new .303 Vickers Guns, which were an immense improvement. The usual working
         parties were supplied during the next few days during which the Battalion was
         supplied with gas helmets to replace the respirators, which had previously been
         our somewhat dubious protection against the most dreaded of all enemy weapons,
         Gas.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1915-09-02">September 2nd</span>, unexpected orders were received
         to relieve the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment in trenches that night, but the
         march to trenches was considerably delayed by very heavy shelling of the Canal
         bridges, which had to be crossed; eventually, however, the relief was completed
         with very few casualties. The weather, which had been fine and warm for the past
         fortnight, now broke completely, and heavy rain for the next two days caused
         much damage to trenches, and necessitated an immense amount of work in drainage
         and repair. On <span title="1915-09-05">September 5th</span> an unlucky isolated
         shrapnel shell killed two men and wounded two officers, Lieuts. <a href="people-index.html#Lowe, Archibald Marston, Lt" title="Lowe, Archibald Marston, Lt" id="pers123">
            Lowe
            </a> and <a href="people-index.html#Bone, W David Muirhead, Capt" title="Bone, W David Muirhead, Capt" id="pers124">
            Bott</a>, and several men; the effect of a single shell in casualties was
         sometimes greater than that of a severe bombardment at other times.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1915-09-08">September 8th</span>, the Battalion was relieved in
         the front line, and sent back to Brigade Reserve, being distributed with one
         Company and Battalion Headquarters at the railway dug-outs, two Companies 
         [<a id="p40" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/40/mode/1up">p40</a>]
          in the dug-outs back at Brigade Headquarters
         with one Company in immediate support of the front line in the newly constructed
         dug-outs behind Square Wood. During the next few days the usual working parties
         were supplied, and a small draft of 20 men joined the Battalion, but our
         casualties had been rather heavy during the last two months, and we were at the
         time very much below our establishment.</p>
      
      <p>On the night of <span title="1915-09-14">September 14th</span> we relieved the
         1/4th Leicestershire Regiment in trenches, a heavy bombardment of the Square
         Wood dug-outs having taken place during the afternoon, which necessitated the
         provision and occupation of shelter trenches along the west end of the wood.
         However, another heavy bombardment on the <span title="1915-09-15">next
            day</span> led to the abandonment of these dug-outs, except for a small garrison
         of one platoon, for whom ample shelter trenches were available, as it was
         evident that the construction of these dug-outs, although behind the Wood and
         not under direct observation of the enemy, had been carefully noted from German
         aeroplanes. The shelter galleries at Battalion Headquarters were now complete,
         somewhat to the relief of the Headquarters details, as the Headquarters dug-outs
         had suffered rather severely lately, one shell actually penetrating into the
         Orderly Room dug-out, but fortunately not exploding.</p>
      
      <p>On the <span title="1915-09-15">15th</span>, as one of our trenches, No. 47, had
         received undue attention from "sausages" and rifle grenades,
         an organised retaliation was arranged by <a href="people-index.html#Nichols, John Sebastian, Capt" title="Nichols, John Sebastian, Capt" id="pers125">
            2nd Lieut.
            Nichols</a>, the Bombing Officer, which was evidently successful, as shown by a
         message which was thrown over into our trenches on the following evening,
         wrapped round a stone. The following is an extract from the message.</p> 
      <blockquote>Why
         on earth do you shoot so idiotically? If we are ordered to fling over two or
         three hand grenades, 
         [<a id="p41" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/41/mode/1up">p41</a>]

         you to send immediately a dozen into our trenches? Stop this nonsence! My
         best friend has been killed because of this. Let us show ourselves in this
         great World War honourable civilized human beings.</blockquote> 
      <p>The receipt of
         this epistle was felt by our bombers to be very gratifying.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1915-09-17">September 17th</span> we experienced the heaviest
         bombardment to which we were ever subjected during our tour in the Salient. From
         11.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m., a desultory bombardment with <abbr title="High Explosive">H.E.</abbr> of various calibres, together with "Whizz-bangs",
         and "Woolly-bears" (heavy shrapnel) was directed on our
         trenches; this apparently was in the nature of registration, and no serious
         damage was done. For an hour there was complete calm, when suddenly at 5.30 p.m.
         an intense bombardment of the whole of the front line facing Hill 60 with
         shrapnel and <abbr title="High Explosive">H.E.</abbr> of all calibres from 8 inch to whizz-bangs began, and continued for an
         hour. Telephonic communication was almost immediately cut from Battalion
         Headquarters to all Companies and also to Brigade and direct observation was
         almost impossible, owing to dust and smoke; each Company Commander had therefore
         to make independent plans to meet an infantry attack which we felt to be
         imminent. At 6.30 p.m., however, the bombardment suddenly ceased without any
         attempt at a German attack, and it was possible to examine the damage done. The
         casualties were marvellously few, one killed, and two wounded, but the material
         damage to trenches was immense. One long stretch of trench, 47 S., was
         practically obliterated for some 200 yards, but fortunately this part was not
         garrisoned, being practically a communication trench, but the result was that
         the right Company was cut off from the remainder of the Battalion by daylight.

         gallant conduct on this occasion; when his trench was practically demolished by
         the bombardment, he went out under heavy fire to rescue a <a href="people-index.html#Nicholson, A, 3215" title="Nicholson, A, 3215" id="pers804">Sergeant</a>, who had
         been cut off and badly wounded. Other trenches also suffered severely and the
         whole Battalion worked hard all night at repair, but finding that it was
         impossible to restore communication between the different parts of the front
         line within a reasonable time, the Commanding Officer requested help from
         Brigade, and on the evening of <span title="1915-09-18">September 18th</span>, a
         working party of 200 from the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment was sent up to our
         assistance, and by daylight on <span title="1915-09-19">September 19th</span> our
         trench line was practically repaired.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1915-09-20">September 20th</span> began the long sustained
         preliminary bombardment of the Battle of <a id="place166" href="place-index.html?n=Loos-en-Gohelle, France" title="Loos-en-Gohelle, France">Loos</a>, continuing up to the <span title="1915-09-25">25th</span>, but
         during this period our sector was particularly quiet. We were relieved the same
         evening by 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment, and went back as Divisional Reserve,
         being quartered in huts in a wood between <a id="place167">Ouderdom</a> and <a id="place168" href="place-index.html?n=Dikkebus, Ieper, Belgium" title="Dikkebus, Ieper, Belgium">Dickebusch</a>,
         and allowed two days for rest. On the <span title="1915-09-23">23rd</span> in
         view of the possibility of a rapid move in the near future, a packing trial was
         carried out, the whole Transport being rapidly loaded up in the presence of the
         Divisional Commander. The usual working parties were supplied during the next
         two days and on the <span title="1915-09-26">26th</span> we returned to trenches
         on a very wet night, which caused the march to the trenches over the mud roads
         to be very heavy going, and the men arrived tired out, and wet through. On the
         <span title="1915-09-25">previous day</span> with a view to supporting the
         attack of the 3rd and 14th Divisions at <a id="place169">Hooge</a>, a subsidiary operation to <a id="place170" href="place-index.html?n=Loos-en-Gohelle, France" title="Loos-en-Gohelle, France">Loos</a>, a demonstration by the Divisional artillery and machine guns

         the enemy, and remained in charge until ordered to go to the dressing station;
         for this gallant conduct he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. No
         attack was made, but heavy rifle fire was directed by the enemy on the position,
         which rendered repair very difficult, and <a href="people-index.html#Finnie, Bertram Knott, Capt (d 1915)" title="Finnie, Bertram Knott, Capt (d 1915)" id="pers132">

      <p>It had
         now become known that the Division, which really needed a rest after three
         months strenuous trench warfare, was shortly to be withdrawn from the Line, and
         on <span title="1915-10-02">October 2nd</span> the Battalion was relieved in the
         trenches at 11.45 p.m., and returned to the huts at <a id="place171" href="place-index.html?n=Dikkebus, Ieper, Belgium" title="Dikkebus, Ieper, Belgium">Dickebusch</a> for the night. At 1.45 p.m. <span title="1915-10-03">next day</span>, we turned our backs on the <a id="place172" href="place-index.html?n=Ieper, Belgium" title="Ieper, Belgium">Ypres</a> Salient with great satisfaction, marching headed by the

         near <a id="place175" href="place-index.html?n=Bethune, France" title="Bethune, France">Bethune</a>. Arriving at 8.30 p.m.,
         the Battalion marched once more on the well known Pavé roads, which we had
         almost forgotten in the <a id="place176" href="place-index.html?n=Ieper, Belgium" title="Ieper, Belgium">Ypres</a> Sector,
         where the road to trenches was only a mud track, to the village of <a id="place177" href="place-index.html?n=Gonnehem, France" title="Gonnehem, France">Gonnehem</a>, where comfortable billets were
         found. For the first time for many months we were outside the range of shell
         fire and the day's rest on the <span title="1915-10-03">3rd</span> was greatly
         enjoyed; the only work done was the refitting of the men with clothing, much of
         which was worn out by the trench work of the last three months. On <span title="1915-10-04">October 4th</span> some Company training was carried out,
         and at a conference at Brigade Headquarters the Divisional Commander outlined
         the next task ahead of the Division, the attack on the Hohenzollern Redoubt, N.
         of <a id="place178" href="place-index.html?n=Loos-en-Gohelle, France" title="Loos-en-Gohelle, France">Loos</a>. <span title="1915-10-05">Next
            day</span> Company training, bayonet fighting and bomb-throwing were
         practised, and a party of officers were conducted over the captured German

         [<a id="p45" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/45/mode/1up">p45</a>]

         <a id="place181" href="place-index.html?n=Hesdigneul-les-Bethune, France" title="Hesdigneul-les-Bethune, France">Hesdigneul</a>, where Headquarters and half the Battalion found quarters, but owing to
         the crowded condition of the area, occupied as it was by a squadron of the Royal
         Flying Corps, no room could be found for the other half Battalion, which
         eventually found billets in the adjoining village of <a id="place182" href="place-index.html?n=Gosnay, France" title="Gosnay, France">Gosnay</a>. In these quarters we remained for the
         next six days practising Company and Battalion attack in open warfare, the
         actual formations to be adopted in the attack on the Hohenzollern Redoubt being
         assiduously rehearsed. A model of the position was constructed at Divisional
         Headquarters which was studied by the officers, and every opportunity was
         afforded to all ranks to learn the exact part they were expected to perform in
         the forthcoming operation. The <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers807">Commanding Officer</a>, <a href="people-index.html#Hoghton, Vere de, Capt (d 1915)" title="Hoghton, Vere de, Capt (d 1915)" id="pers808">Adjutant</a>, and Company Commanders visited
         the trenches to be taken over from the Irish Guards facing the Hohenzollern
         Redoubt from which the attack would be launched. On the morning of <span title="1915-10-09">October 9th</span> the Commanding Officers of the Brigade
         were seen in conference by the Army Commander, <a href="people-index.html#Haig, Douglas, Field Marshall" title="Haig, Douglas, Field Marshall" id="pers138">
            Sir

         The night of <span title="1915-10-11">October 11th</span> was the last night
         spent in billets by the Battalion, who looked forward with confidence to their
         first test in attacking an enemy position.</p>
