      <h2>The Attack on Lens</h2>
      
      <p>As the Germans showed no signs of any intention to evacuate <a id="place481" href="place-index.html?n=Lens, France" title="Lens, France">Lens</a>, preparations were made to put pressure
         on them to do so, and the 138th Brigade was detailed to attack Hill 65, <abbr title="South-West">S.W.</abbr> of <a id="place482" href="place-index.html?n=Lens, France" title="Lens, France">Lens</a>, as a preliminary to
         a further advance. Assembly trenches were prepared for this attack, a model of
         the position was constructed at Fosse 10, which was studied by the officers at
         convenient opportunities, while the Battalion training was conducted specially
         with reference to the attack, and a taped course at Marqueffles Farm was visited by
         the whole Battalion. <a href="people-index.html#Kemp, Geoffrey Chicheley, Brig-Gen" title="Kemp, Geoffrey Chicheley, Brig-Gen" id="pers298">Brigadier-General
            G. C.
            Kemp, <abbr title="Companion of the Order of the Bath">C.B.</abbr></a>, having been compelled through sickness to relinquish
         the command of the Brigade, was temporarily succeeded by <a href="people-index.html#Thorpe, Gervase, Lt-Col" title="Thorpe, Gervase, Lt-Col" id="pers299">Lieut.-Col.
            G. Thorpe</a>, <abbr title="General Staff Officer First Grade">G.S.O. I</abbr> of the 46th Division.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1917-05-28">May 28th</span> billets were changed and the Battalion
         moved from <a id="place484" href="place-index.html?n=Sains-en-Gohelle, France" title="Sains-en-Gohelle, France">Petit Sains</a> to <a id="place485" href="place-index.html?n=Bully-les-Mines, France" title="Bully-les-Mines, France">Bully</a> <a id="place731" href="place-index.html?n=Grenay, France" title="Grenay, France">Grenay</a>, where we were at the disposal of

On <span title="1917-05-30">May 30th</span> at a ceremonial parade at Marqueffles Farm, ribands for medals recently awarded were
         presented by the <a href="people-index.html#Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" title="Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" id="pers883"><abbr title="General Officer Commanding">G.O.C.</abbr> 46th Division</a>. Large working parties were constantly
         required, but daily training was carried on by all available. On <span title="1917-06-02">June 2nd</span> the Battalion was taken over the taped
         course at Marqueffles Farm, and <span title="1917-06-03">next day</span> the model at Fosse 10 was inspected by all
         ranks, while on the <span title="1917-06-04">4th</span> a rehearsal of the attack
         over the taped course was carried out before the <a href="people-index.html#Holland, Arthur Edward Aveling, Lt-Gen" title="Holland, Arthur Edward Aveling, Lt-Gen" id="pers884">Corps</a> and <a href="people-index.html#Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" title="Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" id="pers885">Divisional</a> Commanders. On the <span title="1917-06-05">5th</span> a day's rest was allowed, and the Battalion 
         [<a id="p120" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/120/mode/1up">p120</a>]
          sports were held in the afternoon; after a
         Brigade conference it was announced that the scheme of operations on the <span title="1917-06-08">8th</span> had been changed, the attack being altered to a
         raid, as only a portion of the trench line occupied was to be retained, and
         consolidated. On the evening of the <span title="1917-06-06">6th</span> the
         Battalion again changed quarters, taking over the reserve area at <a id="place488" href="place-index.html?n=Angres, France" title="Angres, France">Angres</a> from the 1/6th Sherwood Foresters,
         where the <span title="1917-06-07">7th</span> was spent resting, while the final
         preparations were made for <span title="1917-06-08">next day</span>.</p>
      
      <p>At 5.30 p.m. on <span title="1917-06-08">June 8th</span>, the Battalion marched
         from Red Mill to cellars in the vicinity of the church and Souchez River. At
         8.30 p.m. the 138th Brigade raided the enemy defences on Hill 65, and round
         Fosse 3, the assaulting Battalions being the 1/4th Lincolnshire and the 1/5th
         Leicestershire Regiments with the 1/4th Leicestershire as "Moppers
         Up" and the 1/5th Lincolnshire in reserve. The active operations that
         the Battalion took part in were as follows:</p>
      
      <p>C Company, detailed for wiring in front of the captured enemy trenches, was
         ordered to proceed at 10.30 p.m., but the start was postponed by a Brigade
         Order, and the Company eventually reached its destination about midnight.
         <a href="people-index.html#Emerson, John E, Capt" title="Emerson, John E, Capt" id="pers300">Lieut.
            J. E.
            Emerson</a> in command showed great coolness
         and courage in organizing the work under heavy fire, and also assisted in the
         consolidation of the captured trench, when no other officer was available.
         <a href="people-index.html#Pickard, Herbert, 240010 (d 1917)" title="Pickard, Herbert, 240010 (d 1917)" id="pers301">Company-Sergt.-Major
            H. Pickard</a>
         also exhibited conspicuous coolness and courage in issuing the stores and
         organizing the parties at the dump under heavy shell fire, which he completely
         disregarded; he was later of great assistance to his <a href="people-index.html#Emerson, John E, Capt" title="Emerson, John E, Capt" id="pers886">Company
            Commander</a> in superintending the work and encouraging the men and set a fine
         example. The company put out screw pickets and four strands of wire and 
         [<a id="p121" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/121/mode/1up">p121</a>]
          supports on a front of 300 yards in front of
         Brick trench—the work was completed at 1.45 a.m., and the company returned to
         billets.</p>
      
      <p>A Lewis Gun section, rifle section and bombers took over a post in Absolom
         trench, and moved forward with the assaulting battalions, withdrawing again with
         the general withdrawal. A platoon of A Company detailed for carrying bombs for a
         further raid at 10 p.m., did not receive a message that the further raid was
         cancelled and consequently moved forward at the hour ordered, and came in
         contact with the enemy in superior numbers; some fighting took place, and the
         platoon withdrew with one casualty. Another party of A Company were detailed to
         carry ladders for the <abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr> at 10.10 p.m. from Assert trench to the assembly trenches, and having
         performed the duty returned to billets. The Battalion also furnished two
         stragglers' posts.</p>
      
      <p>On return to billets at 4.30 a.m. on the <span title="1917-06-09">9th</span>, D
         Company, under <a href="people-index.html#Collins, Charles, Capt" title="Collins, Charles, Capt" id="pers302">
            Captain
            Collins</a>, received verbal orders from the Brigadier to move forward again to
         support the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment, who were being counter-attacked. The
         enemy counterattack, however, was repulsed, and the Company did not come into
         action, and returned to billets later in the day. Having rested in the billets
         round Red Mill for the day, on the evening of the <span title="1917-06-09">9th</span> the Battalion relieved the 1/4th Lincolnshire and the 1/5th
         Leicestershire Regiments in the right sub-sector at <a id="place489" href="place-index.html?n=Lievin, France" title="Lievin, France">Lievin</a> (<a id="place490">Cité de

         for a Company raid to be carried out during the tour, and D Company was selected
         for the operation, which was fixed, for the <span title="1917-06-12">12th</span>,
         and arrangements were made by the <a href="people-index.html#Waring, Henry Archibald, Lt-Col" title="Waring, Henry Archibald, Lt-Col" id="pers887">

            </a> for the co-operation of the Artillery, and the 11th Canadian Infantry
         Brigade on our right.</p>
      
      <p>At 5 a.m. on <span title="1917-06-12">June 12th</span>, C Company from the 
         [<a id="p122" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/122/mode/1up">p122</a>]
          support line took over trenches from D
         Company who at 7 a.m. carried out a daylight raid, the raiding party consisting
         of two officers, <a href="people-index.html#Collins, Charles, Capt" title="Collins, Charles, Capt" id="pers303">
            Captain
            Collins
            </a> and <a href="people-index.html#Brown, Lt (not P K)" title="Brown, Lt (not P K)" id="pers304">
            Lieut.
            Brown</a>, and 86 Other Ranks. Punctually at the zero hour the artillery
         barrage opened and the raiding party left the assembly trenches, the men moving
         forward to the bottom of the slag-heap; no wire was encountered and the enemy
         were evidently taken by surprise, and did not put down a barrage until the party
         were well over the open ground, and at the foot of the slag-heap the platoon
         Sergeants were able to move along the line to see their men were in the correct
         positions. Unfortunately at this point both the officers and several men were
         wounded by our artillery, which was short; <a href="people-index.html#Collins, Charles, Capt" title="Collins, Charles, Capt" id="pers305">
            Captain
            Collins
            </a> however remained out until the Company withdrew, and was the last
         man to re-enter our own line. When the Company advanced up the slag heap
         <a href="people-index.html#Hamp, Wilfred Ernest, 240440 (d 1917)" title="Hamp, Wilfred Ernest, 240440 (d 1917)" id="pers306">

            W. E.
            Hamp</a> took over command, and showed great
         gallantry and ability in handling the company, seeing the objective gained, and
         superintending the withdrawal. The company moved in two waves of platoons; on
         the left the leading platoon, No. 14, entered the enemy trench, established a
         bombing post, opened fire on some of the enemy, who were retiring, and held on
         till the withdrawal was ordered at 25 minutes after zero hour; No. 16 platoon,
         which followed up No. 14, could not reach the house which was their objective,
         as they were held up by our own barrage falling on it; No. 13, the leading
         platoon on the right, entered the enemy trench, established a bombing post,
         bombed a dug-out, and withdrew with the remainder of the company as arranged;
         No. 15 platoon, which followed No. 13, like No. 16, was prevented from reaching
         their objective by our own barrage. A special bombing party, consisting of 
         [<a id="p123" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/123/mode/1up">p123</a>]
          specially selected <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officers">N.C.O.'s</abbr> and men from other companies, endeavoured to bomb down Brick trench
         and join hands with the Canadians on our right. A German dug-out was bombed, the
         sentry being killed, but several of the enemy came out into the trench through
         another entrance, ran round a traverse, and then fled across the open, being
         dealt with by Lewis gun and rifle fire, and casualties inflicted. Another party
         of the enemy came forward from Boot trench, but were dealt with in the same way.
         Our party advanced along the trench for a considerable way but could not join
         the Canadians before the time fixed for withdrawal.</p>
      
      <p>The <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officers">N.C.O.'s</abbr> in command did excellent work, especially <a href="people-index.html#Darley, Frank, 240203" title="Darley, Frank, 240203" id="pers307">Sergeant

          Battalion Transport gained 3rd prize for the
         best turn-out in the Corps; the success of the Transport in the Brigade,
         Divisional, and Corps Shows was largely due to the excellent work of <a href="people-index.html#Linley, Hugh Banks, Capt" title="Linley, Hugh Banks, Capt" id="pers326">Lieut.

            Linley</a>, the Transport Officer. In the
         evening we relieved the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment in the line at <a id="place496">Cité de Riaumont</a>, A Company on the right, and
         B Company in the centre, with a company of the 1/5th Leicestershire remaining in
         the line on the left; D Company were in cellars in <a id="place497">Cité Garenne</a>, and C Company in cellars with Battalion
         Headquarters in <a id="place498" href="place-index.html?n=Lievin, France" title="Lievin, France">Lievin</a>. After the
         relief the Battalion carried up bombs, rockets, wire, rations, and water and got
         very little rest during the night. During the morning of the <span title="1917-06-19">19th</span> when the companies were fitted out for attack,
         Battalion Headquarters were moved to <a id="place499">Cité
            Garenne</a>, and companies detailed as follows: Assaulting companies, A
         and B; wiring company C; carrying company D; the strength being: A Company 2
         officers, 89 other ranks; B Company 2 officers, 75 other ranks; C Company 1
         officer 80 other ranks. Owing to the shortage of officers, none could be left
         behind. The two assaulting companies were in position by 2 p.m., C Company in
         assembly trenches near the left of the assaulting companies, while D Company
         remained in cellars until wanted. Zero hour was 2.30 p.m. and the barrage
         opened, and the assaulting companies advanced in two waves punctually. At Zero
         plus 6 minutes the enemy put down a barrage on our assembly trenches, especially
         on the left, but this did not interfere with our advance. The right Company got
         into the trenches without difficulty or casualties, many of the enemy were
         killed and some 30 taken prisoners, others being driven towards the Canadians on
         our right, who took 18 prisoners, who belonged to the 118th Regiment. The left

         the road and considerable resistance by rifle fire and bombing, causing a number
         of casualties, and was temporarily checked, but again advanced, drove the
         Germans from the trenches with rifle-grenade and rifle fire, and gained their

      <p>The Canadians on our right assisted in the attack, and touch was gained between
         them and both assaulting Companies. Two platoons of the carrying Company
         followed the second wave, and halted below the slag heap, thus forming an
         immediate support. The other two platoons of D Company at once started carrying
         bombs forward to the dump below the slag heap. The left company having suffered
         many casualties was re-inforced at 3.30 p.m. by the two supporting platoons of D

         slag heap, where two platoons were left in support, and two platoons went
         forward to reinforce the line. Three attempts at counter-attack were made by the

         the <abbr title="Save Our Souls">S.O.S.</abbr> was sent up and immediately responded to by our artillery, rifle and

         4 Other Ranks; missing 1; total 74. During the night the right company of the

         of these men at the risk of his own and was awarded the Military Medal for
         gallantry and devotion to duty. As there was very little shelling at the time, a
         booby-trap was suspected, and the matter was investigated by the Australian
         tunnelling company, and it was established that the dug-outs had been mined by
         the Germans before retiring, the mines being placed in the dug-out roofs, the
         system of firing being by means of a wire passing through an acid bath. During
         the <span title="1917-06-27">27th</span>, six more dug-outs blew up, but
         fortunately they had been previously evacuated, and so no casualties were caused

      <p>On the evening of <span title="1917-06-27">June 27th</span>, the remainder of the
         Brigade took over their battle positions for the attack <span title="1917-06-28">next day</span> and relieved us in the line, and the Battalion went into
         reserve in <a id="place502" href="place-index.html?n=Lievin, France" title="Lievin, France">Lievin</a> for the night. At
         2.30 a.m. on the <span title="1917-06-28">28th</span> the Canadians attacked and
         captured a section of enemy trench on our right, and at 7.10 p.m. on the same
         day the Brigade with the 1/5th South Staffordshire Regiment attacked the enemy
         defences east of Hill 65, Abode, Adjunct, and Adjacent trenches, gaining all
         their objectives and consolidating the captured position. The Battalion moved up
         to its assembly position in reserve at 6 p.m., A and C Companies in <a id="place503">Cité des Garennes</a>, and B and D in cellars near

         were to be the 1/4th and 1/5th Lincolnshire Regiments, the next two days were
         devoted to rest and preparations for the attack; the area was subjected to some

      <p>At Zero hour, 2.47 a.m., both companies started punctually; it was still very
         dark and the right company lost direction somewhat, going too far to the right,
         and although touch was kept with the 1/4th Lincolnshire on the right, it was
         temporarily lost with the left company. It seems likely that the enemy had
         noticed the assembly, as his barrage came down not more than a minute after
         Zero, and his machine guns opened at once and fired through our barrage. For the
         sake of clearness it is desirable to describe the action of the two companies
         separately.</p>
      
      <p>The left Company on entering the <a id="place510">Cité de
            Moulin</a> met with a certain amount of wire, not a serious obstacle,
         but sufficient to cause the barrage to outpace them. Some men penetrated the
         houses, but were everywhere held up by heavy machine gun 
         [<a id="p132" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/132/mode/1up">p132</a>]
          and rifle fire. At 3.15 a.m. the support company came up,
         under <a href="people-index.html#Disney, Sydney Cecil William, Maj" title="Disney, Sydney Cecil William, Maj" id="pers360">
            Captain
            Disney</a>, who now took command of this portion of the line, and after making
         a personal reconnaissance, he sent forward patrols, who located the enemy's
         position, but could make no impression either in front or flanks, and as the
         rifle and machine gun fire was heavy, <a href="people-index.html#Disney, Sydney Cecil William, Maj" title="Disney, Sydney Cecil William, Maj" id="pers361">
            Captain
            Disney
            </a> ordered the line to be dug in, and the position already gained to be
         consolidated. About 4.15 a.m. a patrol was sent out to try and gain touch with
         the 137th Brigade on the left, but they were heavily fired on, and no sign of
         our troops could be found, so a defensive flank was formed. About 5 a.m. the
         enemy appeared in strength about the houses in front, apparently intending to
         counter-attack, but were dispersed by our rifle and Lewis gun fire. Meanwhile,
         digging in had been carried on under heavy shell and machine gun fire all the
         time, and this was continued throughout the day. At 6.30 a.m., three patrols
         under <a href="people-index.html#Madden, Clarence Rowland, Lt" title="Madden, Clarence Rowland, Lt" id="pers362">
            2nd Lieut.
            Madden</a>, were sent forward as it appeared possible that, as the objective
         line had been gained on the right and almost gained on the left, the enemy would
         retire if pressed. These patrols got forward some distance among the houses, but
         were met by heavy fire and could make no further progress. Another patrol about
         10 a.m. gained touch with the 137th Brigade on the left, but could get no
         definite information as to their position, and for several hours no further
         movement could be made.</p>
      
      <p>About 2 p.m. <a href="people-index.html#Leadbeater, Conrad, 240252 Capt" title="Leadbeater, Conrad, 240252 Capt" id="pers363">Sergeant
            Leadbeater, <abbr title="Distinguished Conduct Medal">D.C.M.</abbr> and bar</a>, in command of the left post having located the
         position of an enemy machine gun, went forward on his own initiative to attack
         it single handed by bombing. Before he could reach it the enemy machine gun team
         fled, but he captured several belts of ammunition. Shortly afterwards he saw 
         [<a id="p133" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/133/mode/1up">p133</a>]
          the enemy about 50 strong massing on his
         flank; although his party was only 10 or 12 strong, he at once attacked, opening
         fire with Lewis guns and rifles; several of the enemy were seen to fall and the
         remainder got into the houses. For half-an-hour the party remained in a forward
         position and fired on the enemy seen moving from house to house. <a href="people-index.html#Leadbeater, Conrad, 240252 Capt" title="Leadbeater, Conrad, 240252 Capt" id="pers364">
            Sergeant
            Leadbeater

         Cross, but was awarded a second bar to his <abbr title="Distinguished Conduct Medal">D.C.M.</abbr></p>
      
      <p>About 3.30 p.m. the enemy shelling increased to a great intensity on the front of
         <a id="place511">Cité de Moulin</a>, much movement was
         observed, and apparently another counter attack was contemplated; however, rifle
         and Lewis gun fire was kept up steadily, and nothing occurred. When information
         was received that the enemy was moving in strength on our left flank, the
         reserve (C) Company were sent up to strengthen it. About 6 p.m., owing to heavy
         shelling and the fact that no cover was available, our advanced posts were
         withdrawn in order to make a continuous line. At 9 p.m. orders were received to
         attack the houses occupied by the enemy, without artillery support, at 10 p.m.,
         and bombing and bayonet parties advanced up to the houses, but they were found
         occupied in strength, and no progress could be made. Another attempt was made at
         11 p.m. but by this time the enemy had established a regular line close to our
         front, and nothing could be done.</p>
      
      <p>The right Company (D) suffered some casualties in the assembly trenches, and on
         advancing met with some opposition from a machine gun, which was put out of
         action by our Lewis guns, and they went forward towards their objective, but the
         enemy held an organised position on a road in front in considerable strength, so
         <a href="people-index.html#Squire, Edwin Ross, Capt" title="Squire, Edwin Ross, Capt" id="pers365">
            Lieut.
            Squire
            </a> decided to hold the line gained. At 3 a.m. the enemy opened 
         [<a id="p134" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/134/mode/1up">p134</a>]
          fire with rifle grenades and bombs, and
         shortly afterwards left his position and counter-attacked. He was met by rifle
         and Lewis gun fire, and apparently suffered considerable loss as his line
         disappeared and bombing ceased. As touch at this time was lost with both flanks,
         the company withdrew a short distance, and took up a fresh defensive line, when
         the enemy again advanced in considerable strength and in good order for a second
         counter-attack, which was again dispersed by our rifle and Lewis gun fire. The
         Company then dug in under heavy fire and attempted to gain touch with both
         flanks, which was satisfactorily accomplished. <a href="people-index.html#Fevre, Frank Edward Bayliss Le, 2nd Lt" title="Fevre, Frank Edward Bayliss Le, 2nd Lt" id="pers366">Second Lieut.
            F. E.
            B. Le
            Fevre</a>, who was in command of the right half of
         the supporting company, did excellent work during the day and made it his
         special mission to keep touch between the right and left companies frequently
         passing over open ground under heavy fire, and won the Military Cross. About
         9.15 p.m. the left flank of the right company, which had got further forward
         than the left company, was slightly withdrawn to link up in one line with the
         latter. When orders were received at 10 p.m. to mop up the houses in front this
         change in position was taking place, bombs and ammunition were running short,
         casualties had been heavy and the enemy was found to be holding the houses
         strongly, and <a href="people-index.html#Squire, Edwin Ross, Capt" title="Squire, Edwin Ross, Capt" id="pers367">
            Lieut.
            Squire
            </a> decided very rightly that the attempt should not be made. All
         through the day he had shown great resource and initiative and commanded the
         Company with great skill, displaying personal courage of a high order, and the
         Military Cross was subsequently awarded to him.</p>
      
      <p>Throughout the day the companies in the advanced positions were subject to heavy
         and continuous fire, and did extremely well under very trying circumstances. The
         enemy and his machine guns were in stronger numbers than was expected, 
         [<a id="p135" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/135/mode/1up">p135</a>]
          and it was apparent that the cellars in the
         houses in the <a id="place512">Cité de Moulin</a> were
         joined up; in these circumstances, with good cover, his fighting qualities were
         found to be higher than was expected from the 11th Reserve Division opposed to
         us, whose morale was known to be low from having been badly punished on several
         occasions this year. Several <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officers">N.C.O.'s</abbr> and men greatly distinguished themselves in the attack, and in the
         repulse of actual or threatened counter-attacks. <a href="people-index.html#Lunn, George Robert, 241750" title="Lunn, George Robert, 241750" id="pers368">Lance-Corporal

         and attacked it with bombs, killing two of the team and causing the rest to
         retire. Later on he led a party forward and established them in a forward post,

         right and left companies, which was held throughout the day. He had previously
