      <h2>Mobilization and Training</h2>
      
      <p>The various Companies of the Battalion having reached their respective
         Headquarters on <span title="1914-08-04">Tuesday, August 4th</span>, were
         dismissed with orders to hold themselves in readiness to assemble at their Drill
         Halls directly the hourly-expected order to mobilize was received. The
         preparation of the necessary detailed orders for Mobilization, and their careful
         revision from time to time, had been the anxious care of the Commanding Officers
         and Adjutants for several years. In the Spring of <span title="1914">1914</span>
         they were finally revised and approved by the Brigade and Divisional Commanders,
         and a printed copy was supplied as a confidential document to all Officers who
         were thus acquainted in minute detail with procedure and duties required. At
         8.42 p.m. on <span title="1914-08-04">August 4th</span>, in accordance with a
         telegraphic order from Headquarters, Lincoln and Leicester Brigade, the laconic
         telegram "Rapid Mobilization" was despatched to all Officers
         from Battalion Headquarters at <a id="place45" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a>.
         The response was excellent, and although <span title="1914-08-05">Wednesday,
            August 5th</span>, was the first official day of mobilization, several
         Companies had already reassembled on <span title="1914-08-04">Tuesday</span>
         night at their Drill Halls, and early on <span title="1914-08-05">Wednesday</span> morning, every Company was busily engaged in the work laid
         down for the first day, medical inspection, provision of necessaries, purchase
         of articles to complete deficiencies of kits, and careful inspection of arms and
         equipment, while the <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers791">Commanding Officer</a>
         
         [<a id="p11" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/11/mode/1up">p11</a>]
          and Battalion Staff took up their Headquarters
         at the Drill Hall at <a id="place46" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a>. Orders
         were issued by telegram to the outlying Companies to proceed by train to
         <a id="place47" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a> early on the following day,
         and by the afternoon of <span title="1914-08-06">Thursday, August 6th</span>, the
         whole Battalion had assembled and were billeted in the South Parade Schools, the
         Transport and Details in the Garden Street Schools, the Officers' Mess at the
         Grange Hotel, while Battalion Headquarters were of course at the Drill Hall in
         Doughty Road. From the first day the mobilization arrangements of this Battalion
         were very seriously hampered by the fact that whereas Territorial Battalions
         generally, including all others in the North Midland Division, were able to
         devote the whole of their time and energy to the procedure of mobilization, we
         at <a id="place48" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a> were called upon at once for
         active guard duties for the docks and harbour, as protection was absolutely
         essential for the harbour, the electric power station, the wireless station at
         <a id="place49">Weelsby</a>, and so on, and the only
         available military force was the Battalion. The strength of the Battalion on
         assembly in <a id="place50" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a> on the second day of
         mobilization was 24 Officers and 780 Other Ranks.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1914-08-07">Friday, August 7th</span>, with the exception of the
         detachment on guard at the <a id="place51">Weelsby</a>
         wireless station the whole Battalion was employed in placing the docks in a
         state of defence, barricading piers, and digging shelter trenches on the beach
         at the mouth of the Humber at <a id="place52" href="place-index.html?n=Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, England" title="Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, England">Cleethorpes</a>, while plans had to be prepared to occupy the defences
         in case of attack.</p>
      
      <p>At 3 a.m. on <span title="1914-08-08">Saturday, August 8th</span>, an alarm was
         given and orders were received from the Officer Commanding the Humber Defences,
         in view of a possible hostile raid, to occupy the positions prepared for the
         defence, and this was done at once. During the day the work of improving the
         defences was 
         [<a id="p12" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/12/mode/1up">p12</a>]
          continued and the next night was
         spent with the Battalion occupying their defence stations, Battalion
         Headquarters being established on board one of the Grimsby and Hook of Holland
         Line vessels, S.S. Dewsbury, in the docks.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1914-08-09">Sunday, August 9th</span>, the strain was relaxed, the
         Battalion was permitted to return to billets and we were able to devote
         ourselves to the necessary duties in connection with mobilization proper, and on
         <span title="1914-08-10">Monday, August 10th</span>, the <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers792">Commanding
            Officer</a> was able to report to Brigade Headquarters according to the
         pre-arranged plan that mobilization was complete, and the Battalion ready to
         move to its war station. The fact that this was possible, in spite of the
         manifold extra duties performed, as has been shown, speaks volumes for the
         keenness, energy, and enthusiasm of all ranks. The Colours of the Battalion were
         escorted to the Parish Church at <a id="place53" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a>
         with due ceremony, and handed to the <a href="people-index.html#Markham, Algernon Augustus, Canon" title="Markham, Algernon Augustus, Canon" id="pers793">Vicar</a> for safe custody.</p>
      
      <p>The provision of the Battalion Transport necessary on mobilization was one of the
         most difficult duties, involving the collection and purchase of the waggons,
         carts, horses, harness and equipment required, as well as selection of suitable
         personnel. The Transport Officer, <a href="people-index.html#Finnie, Bertram Knott, Capt (d 1915)" title="Finnie, Bertram Knott, Capt (d 1915)" id="pers78">Lieut.
            B. K.
            Finnie</a>, worked very hard, and the
         knowledge and experience of the second-in-command, <a href="people-index.html#Stephenson, Harold, Maj" title="Stephenson, Harold, Maj" id="pers79">Major
            H.
            Stephenson</a>, were invaluable in aiding him in a
         very difficult task. In spite of many difficulties and occasional humourous
         catastrophies the vehicles were obtained, a very heterogeneous collection it is
         true, consisting of lorries and brewery waggons for four wheeled, and fish carts
         for two wheeled, carriages. The horses were also a somewhat miscellaneous
         collection, and the harness kaleideoscopic in character, but still by the fifth
         day of mobilization, according to plan, the 
         [<a id="p13" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/13/mode/1up">p13</a>]
         
         Transport was complete, the horses branded and shod, and personnel with a
         knowledge of their duties obtained, thus forming an effective and useful, if not
         ornamental, Detail of the Battalion.</p>
      
      <p>At 3.50 a.m. on <span title="1914-08-11">Tuesday, August 11th</span>, we entrained
         at <a id="place54" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a> Docks Station, having handed
         over all Guard Duties to the 5th Manchester Regiment, which had arrived at
         <a id="place55" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a> on the <span title="1914-08-10">previous day</span>, arriving at <a id="place56" href="place-index.html?n=Derby, England" title="Derby, England">Derby</a> at 9 a.m. The eight miles' march to
         <a id="place57" href="place-index.html?n=Belper, Derbyshire, England" title="Belper, Derbyshire, England">Belper</a>, the war station of the
         Lincoln and Leicester Brigade, in full marching order on a broiling hot August
         morning, after an uncomfortable night in a crowded train, was very trying for
         the men, who had had a very hard week's work with very little sleep, and the
         numbers who were compelled to fall out were uncomfortably large, and gave an
         indication of the physical unfitness of many for immediate active service.</p>
      
      <p>At <a id="place58" href="place-index.html?n=Belper, Derbyshire, England" title="Belper, Derbyshire, England">Belper</a>, the Battalion was billeted in
         various schools, the officers in private houses, while Battalion Headquarters
         were at Bridgehill, where Mr. and Mrs.
         <a href="people-index.html#Strutt, J A (civilian)" title="Strutt, J A (civilian)" id="pers80">J. A.
            Strutt</a> welcomed the Brigade and Battalion Staffs
         as their guests. The four Battalions of the Brigade were concentrated at
         <a id="place60" href="place-index.html?n=Belper, Derbyshire, England" title="Belper, Derbyshire, England">Belper</a>, the Headquarters of the
         Division being at <a id="place61" href="place-index.html?n=Derby, England" title="Derby, England">Derby</a>, and for the
         next few days the training consisted of route marches of gradually increasing
         length in full marching order with the object of hardening and improving the
         physical fitness of all ranks.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1914-08-15">Saturday, August 15th</span>, the Battalion left
         <a id="place62" href="place-index.html?n=Belper, Derbyshire, England" title="Belper, Derbyshire, England">Belper</a>, marching to <a id="place63" href="place-index.html?n=Derby, England" title="Derby, England">Derby</a>, and arrived at 6 p.m. in accordance with
         the order to be at the entraining station one hour before the time fixed for the
         departure of the train, which was 7 p.m. Owing, however, to the dislocation of
         the train service by the entraining of the whole Division, we were kept waiting
         till 11.30 p.m., finally leaving at midnight 
         [<a id="p14" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/14/mode/1up">p14</a>]
         
         for <a id="place64" href="place-index.html?n=Leagrave, Luton, Bedfordshire, England" title="Leagrave, Luton, Bedfordshire, England">Leagrave</a> Station, three miles from
         <a id="place65" href="place-index.html?n=Luton, Bedfordshire, England" title="Luton, Bedfordshire, England">Luton</a>, which was to be the home of
         the Division for the next three months.</p>
      
      <p>The Battalion was billeted at <a id="place66" href="place-index.html?n=Luton, Bedfordshire, England" title="Luton, Bedfordshire, England">Luton</a> under
         various conditions, some Companies in factories, others in empty houses, while a
         certain proportion of men, to their great delight, were fortunate enough to be
         billeted in private houses. Battalion Headquarters with Orderly Room and
         Officers' Mess were established in an empty house in the Biscot Road. During the
         next week all units settled down to steady training, beginning at 7 a.m. and
         ending at 4 p.m. daily, and on the <span title="1914-08-22">22nd</span> a
         Divisional concentration march was practised for the first time. Naturally many
         mistakes occurred, and the criticism of the <a href="people-index.html#Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" title="Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" id="pers794">
            <abbr title="General Officer Commanding">G.O.C.</abbr>
            </a> was severe, but the various units began from this time forward to regard
         themselves not merely as units but as factors in the North Midland Division.</p>
      
      <p>The question of volunteering for active service abroad had first been mooted at
         <a id="place67" href="place-index.html?n=Belper, Derbyshire, England" title="Belper, Derbyshire, England">Belper</a>, when the response was rather
         half-hearted, to the great disappointment of the officers, but the numbers
         rapidly improved, and during the next week, some 650 men having volunteered, the
         Battalion was accepted as a unit for foreign service, as was the whole Division.
         Recruiting was now very brisk, and on <span title="1914-08-31">August 31st</span>
         the Division was reorganized for foreign service, those men who felt themselves
         unable to volunteer being billeted and trained separately, ultimately being
         stationed at <a id="place68" href="place-index.html?n=Dunstable, Bedfordshire, England" title="Dunstable, Bedfordshire, England">Dunstable</a> under <a href="people-index.html#Marshall, H D, Maj" title="Marshall, H D, Maj" id="pers81">Major
            H. D.
            Marshall</a>, thus forming the nucleus of the
         Reserve Battalion.</p>
      
      <p>The newly-organized Foreign Service Battalion was rapidly recruited up to
         establishment, but uniform, arms and equipment were lacking, and were only
         obtained gradually, the demands not being fully supplied for nearly two months.
         It is not 
         [<a id="p15" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/15/mode/1up">p15</a>]
          necessary to describe in detail the
         training for the next two months; it is sufficient to say that it was strenuous
         and thorough. The work was varied by occasional Divisional Field days, and night
         operations were practised at least twice a week. As a rule Battalions with Band
         and Drums marched out in Brigade to the training area, which was of satisfactory
         extent, each Battalion there carrying out the day's programme of work, returning
         to billets again in Brigade; usually a haversack ration was carried, but
         frequently dinners were cooked in the field. Musketry for recruits was carried
         out on the Dunstable range, while a special range was constructed on Wardown
         Hill for trained men. Field firing was practised on a special range at
         <a id="place69" href="place-index.html?n=Dunstable, Bedfordshire, England" title="Dunstable, Bedfordshire, England">Dunstable</a>. On Sundays a ceremonial
         Church Parade was usually held.</p>
      
      <p>During the first week in <span title="1914-09">September</span> the training
         programme had to be considerably modified for some days on account of
         anti-typhoid inoculation, which, necessary as it was realised to be, was very
         unpopular and incapacitated men for a few days, but this was quickly forgotten,
         and the prospect of Service in the Field being nearer, every branch of training
         was resumed with added energy and enthusiasm.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1914-09-29">September 29th</span>, the Division was inspected in
         Luton Hoo Park by <a href="people-index.html#Kitchener, Horatio Herbert, Earl" title="Kitchener, Horatio Herbert, Earl" id="pers82">
            Lord
            Kitchener</a>, who informed the Divisional Commander that the Division would be
         sent abroad as soon as the Reserve Battalions were recruited up to full
         strength, and on <span title="1914-10-17">October 17th</span> orders were
         received for the Division to hold itself in readiness for Foreign Service by
         <span title="1914-10-31">October 31st</span>. There was naturally much
         excitement and every man was given 48 hours' final leave during the next week.
         Training, however, was continued steadily, the looked-for date came and passed
         and 
         [<a id="p16" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/16/mode/1up">p16</a>]
          many fanciful rumours circulated, but no
         order was received until midnight of <span title="1914-11-15">Sunday, November
            15th</span>, when the Battalion was instructed to parade at 7.30 a.m. next
         morning to act as baggage guard to the Division. Our first destination was
         <a id="place71" href="place-index.html?n=Ware, Hertfordshire, England" title="Ware, Hertfordshire, England">Ware</a> in Hertfordshire and the march
         of 28 miles was a very severe test of endurance, but most satisfactorily
         performed by the Battalion, which arrived tired but cheerful at 7.30 p.m. It is
         of interest to note that this march was fully described in a special article in
         the Times with much friendly comment and kindly criticism, the name of the
         Division being of course withheld. On the <span title="1914-11-16">next
            day</span> the Battalion rested in billets, and on <span title="1914-11-18">November 18th</span> marched to <a id="place72" href="place-index.html?n=Stansted, Essex, England" title="Stansted, Essex, England">Stansted</a> in Essex, three miles from <a id="place73" href="place-index.html?n=Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, England" title="Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, England">Bishop's Stortford</a>, where Brigade and Divisional Headquarters
         were located. At <a id="place74" href="place-index.html?n=Stansted, Essex, England" title="Stansted, Essex, England">Stansted</a>, in spite of
         various orders to move, always countermanded within a few hours, the Battalion
         remained in comfortable billets until the Division went abroad. For the first
         three weeks there was ample room, but on <span title="1914-12-09">December
            9th</span> the first <abbr title="North Midland">N.M.</abbr> Artillery Brigade also came into the area, and billets were henceforth
         rather crowded. <a id="place75" href="place-index.html?n=Stansted, Essex, England" title="Stansted, Essex, England">Stansted</a> Park made an
         admirable battalion training ground, and training was steadily continued. The
         weather during the three months at <a id="place76" href="place-index.html?n=Luton, Bedfordshire, England" title="Luton, Bedfordshire, England">Luton</a>
         had been very fine on the whole; afterwards the programme was constantly
         interfered with by bad weather. Brigade and Divisional Field days were only held
         very occasionally, attention being devoted principally to Company and Battalion
         work and musketry, varied by special practices in entraining, bridging,
         entrenching, and so on. The week before Christmas some 400 men returned to Luton
         to complete their musketry course, coming back on <span title="1914-12-23">December 23rd</span>.</p>
      
      <p>The fact that no Christmas leave was given was at first a disappointment to many
         men, but was accepted 
         [<a id="p17" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/17/mode/1up">p17</a>]
          cheerfully as a
         compliment when it was explained that the Territorial Divisions were at the time
         the only trained troops available in case of invasion, the New Armies not being
         yet fit for immediate service. During Christmas week the invasion scare was at
         its height, and we received orders to be ready to move at any minute. In these
         circumstances Christmas was celebrated in the usual fashion, with a holiday on
         <span title="1914-12-25">Christmas day</span> and <span title="1914-12-26">Boxing day</span>. Company dinners were held, an inter-Company football
         competition was carried through and a generally enjoyable time was spent, and
         then hard work began again.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1915-01-01">January 1st, 1915</span>, the new four-company
         Battalion organization was adopted, and the next few weeks were devoted
         principally to Platoon, Company, and Battalion Drill. On <span title="1915-01-05">January 5th</span>, the Battalion went to <a id="place77" href="place-index.html?n=Dunstable, Bedfordshire, England" title="Dunstable, Bedfordshire, England">Dunstable</a> for three days for practice in Field Firing, with the
         exception of the recruits, who in their turn went to <a id="place78" href="place-index.html?n=Luton, Bedfordshire, England" title="Luton, Bedfordshire, England">Luton</a> on the <span title="1915-01-09">9th</span> to complete
         their necessary training, returning on the <span title="1915-01-15">15th</span>.
         The anxiously-awaited orders for Foreign Service were still delayed but at last
         on <span title="1915-02-15">February 15th</span> a definite warning order was
         issued, stating that the Division was to be ready to go abroad at short notice,
         probably on the <span title="1915-02-23">23rd</span>, and all leave was
         cancelled.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1915-02-19">February 19th</span>, to the gratification of all
         ranks, the Division was inspected in <a id="place79" href="place-index.html?n=Great Hallingbury, Essex, England" title="Great Hallingbury, Essex, England">Hallingbury</a> Park by <a href="people-index.html#George V, King" title="George V, King" id="pers795">H.M. the King</a>; a special complimentary order was
         subsequently issued expressing His Majesty's pleasure at seeing the Division,
         and wishing it God-Speed.</p>
      
      <p>The next week was one of feverish excitement, tempered by the expenditure of much
         energy, and very hard work. Clothing, boots, arms, and equipment were very
         thoroughly inspected, and all deficiencies replaced. The Machine Guns were

          converted to take Mark vii. ammunition. Our
         heterogeneous collection of lorries, carts, and harness constituting the
         Transport had been scrapped, and regulation waggons and limbers, with the
         necessary harness, supplied, the careful fitting of the latter being a matter of
         supreme importance. <a href="people-index.html#Taylor, A W M, Brig-Gen" title="Taylor, A W M, Brig-Gen" id="pers83">
            Brig.-General
            Taylor</a>, the Brigade Commander, being found physically unfit for Active
         Service, was succeeded in the command of the Brigade by <a href="people-index.html#Clifford, Walter Rees, Brig-Gen" title="Clifford, Walter Rees, Brig-Gen" id="pers84">
            Brig.-General
            Clifford</a>, who only took over command on the day before our departure.</p>
      
      <p>The Battalion was now completely at war strength in Officers and Other Ranks,
         thoroughly equipped, although only armed with the old long rifle, well trained
         and physically fit as regards personnel, with the Transport in good condition.
         The Machine Gun and Signalling Sections had been carefully trained, and were
         very efficient, and all ranks looked forward with a cheery confidence to Active
         Service in the Field.</p>
