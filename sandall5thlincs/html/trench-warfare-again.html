      <h2>Trench Warfare Again</h2>
      
      <p>The Battalion rested on <span title="1916-07-12">July 12th</span>, and on the
         <span title="1916-07-13">13th</span> marched to <a id="place303" href="place-index.html?n=Saulty, France" title="Saulty, France">Saulty</a> for inspection by <a href="people-index.html#Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" title="Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" id="pers220">Major-General
            W. Thwaites</a>,
         the new Commander of the 46th Division, who had succeeded <a href="people-index.html#Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" title="Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" id="pers221">
            Major-General
            Stuart-Wortley</a>, and after the inspection the <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers840"><abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> Battalion</a> had the gratification of receiving the Divisional
         Commander's opinion of his command, viz., "a very fine
         Battalion."</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1916-07-15">July 15th</span> the Battalion changed billets, and
         marched by Platoons to <a id="place304" href="place-index.html?n=Pommier, France" title="Pommier, France">Pommier</a>, the
         road between <a id="place305" href="place-index.html?n=Bavincourt, France" title="Bavincourt, France">Bazincourt</a> and <a id="place306" href="place-index.html?n=La Cauchie, France" title="La Cauchie, France">La Cauchie</a> being shelled at the time, but no
         casualties were sustained. On the <span title="1916-07-16">16th</span> and <span title="1916-07-17">17th</span> Company training was carried out, and the
         Officers visited the new trench sector <abbr title="North">N.</abbr> of <a id="place307" href="place-index.html?n=Monchy-au-Bois, France" title="Monchy-au-Bois, France">Monchy</a>, which was to be
         taken over from the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment <span title="1916-07-18">next
            day</span>.</p>
      
      <p>On the <span title="1916-07-18">18th</span> the Battalion proceeded by Platoons to
         <a id="place308" href="place-index.html?n=Berles-au-Bois, France" title="Berles-au-Bois, France">Berles</a>, thence by communication
         trenches to the line, and relief was completed by 7.15 p.m. The new sector
         consisted of a line of trenches opposite and to the <abbr title="North">N.</abbr> of <a id="place309" href="place-index.html?n=Monchy-au-Bois, France" title="Monchy-au-Bois, France">Monchy</a>, the distance from
         the enemy lines varying from 80 on the right to 300 yards on the left. Three
         Companies were distributed in trenches, and one Company with Battalion
         Headquarters in dug-outs in the Ravine at Nobody's Bottom, 800 yards in front of
         <a id="place310" href="place-index.html?n=Berles-au-Bois, France" title="Berles-au-Bois, France">Berles</a>. No special incident
         occurred during this tour with the exception of an enemy bombardment of the
         communication trenches with gas shells on the <span title="1916-07-22">22nd</span>—the first 
         [<a id="p84" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/84/mode/1up">p84</a>]
          occasion on which the
         Battalion experienced gas shells, although these had been used by the enemy at
         <a id="place311" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a> on <span title="1916-07-01">July 1st</span>, but had not on that occasion fallen in
         the area we occupied. On the evening of <span title="1916-07-24">July 24th</span>
         we were relieved by 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment by 7.15 p.m., and returned by
         Platoons to <a id="place312" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a>, where we were
         billeted as Brigade Reserve, Brigade Headquarters being situated in the village.
         Next day the Battalion rested, while the officers inspected the <a id="place313" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a> Defences and their Alarm Posts;
         the area was being rather heavily shelled and the party consisting of the
         Battalion Headquarters Officers and Company Commanders had a very narrow escape
         on one occasion. During the next few days at least three Companies were detailed
         for working parties daily on communication trenches and dug-outs, and only the
         specialists were able to carry out any training, while one Company carried out
         musketry on a range between <a id="place314" href="place-index.html?n=La Cauchie, France" title="La Cauchie, France">La Cauchie</a>
         and <a id="place315" href="place-index.html?n=Bailleulmont, France" title="Bailleulmont, France">Bailleulment</a>.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1916-07-30">July 30th</span> we relieved the 1/4th Lincolnshire
         Regiment in trenches at 7.30 p.m., and were rather heavily shelled next morning,
         considerable material damage being done, but no casualties caused. The enemy
         were also very active during this and subsequent days with trench mortars, which
         as usual caused much destruction of trenches but very few casualties. We were
         relieved on the evening of <span title="1916-08-03">August 3rd</span>, but owing
         to heavy shelling of the usual communication trenches, an alternative route had
         to be used to reach the billets at <a id="place316" href="place-index.html?n=Pommier, France" title="Pommier, France">Pommier</a> in Divisional Reserve. Three Companies carried out training
         daily during the next week, the other Company being struck off duty for
         inoculation, and on <span title="1916-08-09">August 9th</span> we returned to
         trenches, relief being completed at 8.30 p.m. During this tour gas cylinders
         were installed in a large number of our 
         [<a id="p85" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/85/mode/1up">p85</a>]
          front
         trenches to the great disgust of the garrisons, as they were a constant source
         of annoyance owing to leakage, and an ever-present danger in case of enemy
         shelling, as damage to a cylinder involved an instantaneous gas cloud in the
         trench, and gave the men no time to put on gas masks; naturally all ranks looked
         eagerly forward to the day, which was unfortunately somewhat distant, when the
         wind would be favourable, and the cylinders discharged to distribute the gas in
         the enemy trenches instead of our own. The enemy remained very quiet, and the
         tour passed without incident until our relief on the <span title="1916-08-15">15th</span>, when the Battalion returned to <a id="place317" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a> as Brigade Reserve. The usual routine of one
         Company training and three Companies working on communication trenches was
         observed until <span title="1916-08-21">August 21st</span> without
         incident except on the 16th, when <a id="place319" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a> was rather heavily shelled with the usual retaliation
         by our artillery.</p>
      
      <p>On the <span title="1916-08-21">21st</span> we relieved the 1/4th Lincolnshire
         Regiment in trenches at 7 p.m., having been joined earlier in the day by two
         officers, 2nd Lieutenants <a href="people-index.html#Vandyk, Edward, Capt" title="Vandyk, Edward, Capt" id="pers222">E.
            Vandyk</a> and <a href="people-index.html#Johnson, F, 2nd Lt" title="Johnson, F, 2nd Lt" id="pers223">F.
            Johnson</a> from the Reserve Battalion. <span title="1916-08-22">Next day</span> our front line was shelled by the enemy
         with heavy howitzers, and six of the cylinders of gas installed in the trenches
         were burst, <a href="people-index.html#Coles, 2nd Lt" title="Coles, 2nd Lt" id="pers224">
            2nd Lieut.
            Coles
            </a> and 14 Other Ranks being badly gassed, one dying later at <a id="place320" href="place-index.html?n=Berles-au-Bois, France" title="Berles-au-Bois, France">Berles</a> Dressing Station. <a href="people-index.html#Hill, Albert, 2611" title="Hill, Albert, 2611" id="pers225">Lance-Corporal
            A. Hill</a>, who
         was in the next bay of the trench in which the cylinders burst, immediately
         realised the danger, and although severely gassed himself, remained in the
         trench, and rapidly warned all men in the neighbourhood to put on their gas
         helmets, rousing up the men asleep in the dug-outs for the same purpose. This
         prompt action and disregard for his personal safety undoubtedly saved several
         lives and prevented more numerous casualties, 
         [<a id="p86" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/86/mode/1up">p86</a>]
         
         and he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his gallantry and
         devotion to duty. The difficulty in preventing casualties on such an occasion as
         this was enhanced by the fact that no alarm could be given by sound, as it was
         most important that the enemy should not know that gas was installed in our
         trenches, or that any unusual damage had been done by his bombardment.</p>
      
      <p><a href="people-index.html#Squire, Edwin Ross, Capt" title="Squire, Edwin Ross, Capt" id="pers226">2nd Lieut.
            R. Squire</a>
         joined the Battalion on the <span title="1916-08-23">23rd</span>, and the
         remainder of the tour passed quietly, work on improvement of the trenches being
         steadily carried on; on the <span title="1916-08-27">27th</span> we were
         relieved, and arrived at <a id="place321" href="place-index.html?n=Pommier, France" title="Pommier, France">Pommier</a>
         billets at 8.30 p.m., acting as Divisional Reserve, where 2nd Lieuts. <a href="people-index.html#Street, Hewson, Capt (d 1918)" title="Street, Hewson, Capt (d 1918)" id="pers227">H.

            Turner</a> joined for duty. Company training,
         especially close order drill, was practised during the next three days, and on
         <span title="1916-09-01">September 1st</span> the Battalion marched to
         <a id="place322">La Bazeque</a>, and was inspected by
         the <a href="people-index.html#Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" title="Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" id="pers841"><abbr title="General Officer Commanding">G.O.C.</abbr> 46th Division</a> in Ceremonial and Battalion Drill, and was
         congratulated by him on an excellent turn-out and march past. In the evening a
         boxing competition aroused great interest, and on the next evening we returned
         to the trenches. On the <span title="1916-09-04">4th</span> the usual monotony
         was relieved by the unusual incident of a deserter coming over to our trenches
         at 8.30 p.m., a private in the 63rd Regiment of Prussian Infantry, who expressed
         himself as "fed up" with the war; he was brought to Battalion
         Headquarters and handed over in due course to the Corps Intelligence branch. The
         weather generally had been wet for the last few days, and much hard work was
         expended on draining and revetting trenches.</p>
      
      <p>On the evening of the <span title="1916-09-08">8th</span>, as a preparatory step
         for a subsequent raid, it was arranged to blow two gaps in the enemy wire. Two
         gas pipes 24 feet long and 1½ inches in diameter were filled with ammonal, and
         fitted with detonators and Nobel lighters, and 
         [<a id="p87" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/87/mode/1up">p87</a>]
         
         were placed in position by a party of 20 specially selected men under Lieuts.

            Goodall</a>, who lighted the fuses and returned. <a href="people-index.html#Goodall, Charles Eric Griffiths, Capt" title="Goodall, Charles Eric Griffiths, Capt" id="pers231">
            Lieut.
            Goodall
            </a> found that his lighter would not burn, and ordered his men to
         retire, while he himself struck a match in the darkness, igniting the fuse, and
         successfully exploding the charge. The parties got back to our trenches without
         casualty, and the operation was quite successful, two practicable gaps being
         created in the enemy wire. Meanwhile the Battalion had been relieved earlier in
         the evening to become Brigade Reserve at <a id="place323" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a> for the next six days.</p>
      
      <p><span title="1916-09-11">September 11th</span> was a holiday on the occasion of
         the Brigade Sports at <a id="place324">La Bezeque</a> Farm,
         which 50 per cent of the Battalion were allowed to attend. Inter-Battalion
         competitions were arranged for the best turn-out of a limber, a field kitchen,
         and a pair of pack ponies, various flat races, a mule race, and a steeplechase,
         but the event which caused the greatest excitement was the Inter-Battalion
         tug-of-war, which we won after a great struggle. A "knife and
         fork" tea was provided for the men, and the whole event was a great
         success. A pleasant day was closed by the whole Battalion carrying gas cylinders
         from <a id="place325" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a> up to the front line
         trenches, a fatigue which was repeated on the next evening.</p>
      
      <p>On the <span title="1916-09-14">14th</span> we returned to the trenches for a very
         quiet but very wet tour, during which the usual trench improvement and
         strengthening of our wire was carried on. On our relief on the <span title="1916-09-20">20th</span> we proceeded to fresh billets at <a id="place326" href="place-index.html?n=La Cauchie, France" title="La Cauchie, France">La Cauchie</a>, the men being in very good and
         comfortable huts, and the officers in better billets than usual. Training was
         conducted on the usual lines, while A Company, who had been selected to carry
         out a raid in the near future, received special training for the purpose. 
         [<a id="p88" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/88/mode/1up">p88</a>]
          The Corps race meeting at <a id="place327">La Bezeque</a> Farm on the afternoon of the <span title="1916-09-25">25th</span> provided most of the officers with a pleasant
         afternoon's amusement, expensive or profitable as the case might be, dependent
         on their success or otherwise with a book-making firm, who appeared in the garb
         and with the paraphernalia usual on an English racecourse. It subsequently
         transpired that the "book-makers" were two officers of the
         Battalion, who received later a severe official reprimand which was greatly
         tempered by the smiling countenance of <a href="people-index.html#Kemp, Geoffrey Chicheley, Brig-Gen" title="Kemp, Geoffrey Chicheley, Brig-Gen" id="pers842">our Brigadier</a>, who was directed to
         administer it.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1916-09-26">September 26th</span> we began another tour in the
         trenches, which was more unpleasant than usual partly from bad weather and
         partly from repeated enemy bombardment with heavy shells and trench mortars. The
         latter was a serious matter, with the gas cylinders still installed in our front
         line, a number of them being damaged on the <span title="1916-09-29">29th</span>
         causing slight gassing of two officers as well as several men. On the <span title="1916-09-30">30th</span> more cylinders were damaged, but on this
         occasion a fairly strong wind was blowing directly from our trenches to the
         enemy's, and although we had no casualties, the noise of gongs and bells and a
         great display of fireworks from the enemy front line was evidence that they must
         have realised the fact that gas cylinders were in our trenches. On the night of
         <span title="1916-10-01">October 1st</span>-<span title="1916-10-02">2nd</span> a patrol in front of our right sector discovered a tape laid by the
         enemy leading from their line to a gap, which had been cut in our wire.
         Preparations were accordingly made to repel the expected raid, but nothing
         abnormal occurred. On the <span title="1916-10-02">2nd</span> we were relieved by
         the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment, and returned to our former billets at
         <a id="place328" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a>. It was decided by the
         higher authorities that the projected gas attack from our trenches, delayed as
         it had been for 
         [<a id="p89" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/89/mode/1up">p89</a>]
          weeks by unfavourable wind and
         weather, should be abandoned, as the enemy probably had discovered the menace,
         and for the next three nights carrying parties were detailed to remove the
         cylinders, and to the great relief of our sister Battalion, the 1/4th
         Lincolnshire Regiment, and ourselves, the task was completed on the night of
         <span title="1916-10-04">October 4th</span>. The former Battalion carried out
         a raid on the night of the <span title="1916-10-05">5th</span> from our trench
         sector, but found the enemy trenches empty! On the <span title="1916-10-08">8th</span> we again relieved them, and passed a quiet tour, although the
         village of <a id="place329" href="place-index.html?n=Berles-au-Bois, France" title="Berles-au-Bois, France">Berles</a> immediately in our
         rear was heavily shelled; on the <span title="1916-10-14">14th</span> we were
         relieved and went back to Divisional Reserve at <a id="place330" href="place-index.html?n=La Cauchie, France" title="La Cauchie, France">La
            Cauchie</a>.</p>
      
      <p>The raid to be carried out by A Company was fixed for <span title="1916-10-18">October 18th</span>, while the Battalion was out of trenches. The Company
         was carefully trained, and the exact details assiduously practised for the few
         days before. A description of this raid in some detail may be interesting as
         more or less typical of raids constantly carried out at this period by other
         units as well as our own.</p>
      
      <p>On the afternoon of the <span title="1916-10-18">18th</span> two gaps were cut in
         the enemy wire by artillery and trench mortar bombardment, and known enemy
         machine gun emplacements were also bombarded by our howitzers A feint
         bombardment of two other points in the enemy front line on each flank of the
         selected points for the raid was also arranged immediately before the hour
         fixed, 8.30 p.m. At 6.30 p.m. patrols, under 2nd Lieuts. <a href="people-index.html#Vandyk, Edward, Capt" title="Vandyk, Edward, Capt" id="pers232">
            Vandyk

            Wellsted</a>, went out to reconnoitre the gaps in the enemy wire, and reported
         both practicable, and at the same time laid tapes to them from gaps prepared in
         our own wire. The Company was organized into two parties, one under the Company

          for the right gap, each party being
         sub-divided into forcing, blocking, clearing, parapet, and flanking parties with
         specially selected leaders. At 8.15 the parties left our trenches, and took up
         their position in No Man's Land, preparatory to rushing the enemy trenches at
         the zero hour, 8.30, when an artillery bombardment of the enemy second line, and
         communication trenches, and various trench junctions was arranged, to continue
         for 30 minutes. The co-operation with the artillery was very good; punctually at
         8.30 the artillery bombardment opened, and the parties rushed to the gaps. On
         the left the raiding party entered the German trench, the blocking party turned
         to the left and blocked the trench when they were beyond bombing distance of the
         point of entrance. The forcing party, moving to the right, shot the German
         sentry at the entrance to a dug-out, and bombed the occupants, passing along to
         a second dug-out, which was also bombed. Identifications of the German garrison
         were obtained, the chief object of the raid, showing them to be the 180th
         Infantry Regiment. The <a href="people-index.html#Dixon, Oscar, Capt" title="Dixon, Oscar, Capt" id="pers843">

            </a> now received a message from his blocking party that they were being
         heavily bombed, and were running short of bombs, and therefore ordered his party
         to retire; the retirement was conducted very skilfully and the party returned to
         our trenches at 8.55 p.m., the only casualty being one man slightly wounded. The
         experience of the right party was not so successful, as, although they reached
         the German parapet, they found themselves unable to enter the trench, as a row
         of knife-rests heavily wired, and pegged to the ground, extended both ways for a
         considerable distance. Attempts were made for 15 minutes to remove the
         obstruction without success, and <a href="people-index.html#Robinson, Mark, Capt" title="Robinson, Mark, Capt" id="pers236">
            Lieut.

         bombing heavily from their support line wounding two of our men, very wisely
         ordered his party to retire to our own trenches.</p>

         all did excellent work, and showed courage and dash, and the conduct of all
         ranks was excellent. A report of the operation was forwarded <span title="1916-10-19">next day</span> to Divisional Headquarters, and the <a href="people-index.html#Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" title="Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" id="pers844">

         next day inspected the raiding party and congratulated them, expressing great
         satisfaction with the organisation and execution of the raid.</p>
      
      <p>We returned to trenches on <span title="1916-10-20">October 20th</span>, the tour
         being marked by very bad weather and increased enemy artillery and trench mortar
         activity, necessitating incessant work on repair of trenches, and we were
         pleased to be relieved on the <span title="1916-10-25">25th</span>, a day before
         we expected, and to return to <a id="place331" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a> billets, more especially as we had been informed that
         the Division was to be withdrawn from the line for a rest. For the next day or
         two careful inspection of boots, clothing, equipment and transport were made
         preparatory to the move, and on the <span title="1916-10-30">30th</span> we were
         relieved by the 19th Liverpool Regiment as Brigade Reserve, and marched to
         <a id="place332" href="place-index.html?n=Halloy, France" title="Halloy, France">Halloy</a> to billet for the night, a

         man.</p>
      
      <p>The prospect of a rest was very welcome; although the trench warfare for the last
         four months had not been especially strenuous or exciting, yet the strain on all
         ranks had been considerable, a good many casualties from wounds, gas poisoning,
         and sickness had been sustained, the weather as a whole had been 
         [<a id="p92" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/92/mode/1up">p92</a>]
          very bad, necessitating very hard work on
         upkeep of trenches, and after six months continuous service in the line we
         looked forward eagerly to a short period of rest outside the shell fire zone, in
         more or less comfortable billets.</p>
