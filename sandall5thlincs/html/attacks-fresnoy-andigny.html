      <h2>The Attacks on Fresnoy and Andigny</h2>
      
      <p>At 5 a.m. on <span title="1918-10-08">October 8th</span> the Battalion moved
         forward to the railway cutting and sunken road in front of <a id="place664" href="place-index.html?n=Ramicourt, France" title="Ramicourt, France">Ramiecourt</a> in support of the 6th Division, who
         attacked in conjunction with the French on our right and the Americans on our
         left. The allotted positions were reached at 8 a.m., and we remained there for
         the whole day, the <a href="people-index.html#Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" title="Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" id="pers941">
            <abbr title="Commanding Officer">C.O.</abbr>

         effect that the 138th Brigade would relieve a Brigade of the 6th Division at
         once. During the night we moved forward, and relieved the 2nd York and Lancaster
         Regiment, the relief being completed just before dawn on <span title="1918-10-09">October 9th</span>, all four companies being in line in the trenches 800
         yards <abbr title="North-West">N.W.</abbr> of <a id="place666" href="place-index.html?n=Mericourt, Croix-Fonsommes, France" title="Mericourt, Croix-Fonsommes, France">Mericourt</a>. At dawn
         patrols, who were pushed forward, reported that the enemy had evacuated his
         positions, and pursuit was at once taken up, A Company under <a href="people-index.html#Nichols, John Sebastian, Capt" title="Nichols, John Sebastian, Capt" id="pers538">Captain
            J. S.

         outskirts of <a id="place667" href="place-index.html?n=Fresnoy-le-Grand, France" title="Fresnoy-le-Grand, France">Fresnoy Le Grand</a>. Orders
         were now received from Brigade that the first objective would be the railway <abbr title="East">E.</abbr> of <a id="place668" href="place-index.html?n=Fresnoy-le-Grand, France" title="Fresnoy-le-Grand, France">Fresnoy</a>, and touch having
         been obtained with the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment on the right, and the 1/4th
         Leicestershire Regiment on the left, the whole Brigade advanced, Battalion
         Headquarters being established in <a id="place669" href="place-index.html?n=Mericourt, Croix-Fonsommes, France" title="Mericourt, Croix-Fonsommes, France">Mericourt</a>.</p>
      
      <p>The advance was held up about 10.30 a.m. along a line <abbr title="North">N.</abbr> and <abbr title="South">S.</abbr> through the centre of <a id="place670" href="place-index.html?n=Fresnoy-le-Grand, France" title="Fresnoy-le-Grand, France">Fresnoy</a>

         the Battalion being C, A and D Companies in line from right to left with B
         Company in support on the <a id="place671">Beauregard</a>-<a id="place672" href="place-index.html?n=Mericourt, Croix-Fonsommes, France" title="Mericourt, Croix-Fonsommes, France">Mericourt</a>
         road. Owing to the fact that our artillery support was late, and the enemy
         artillery active in <a id="place673" href="place-index.html?n=Fresnoy-le-Grand, France" title="Fresnoy-le-Grand, France">Fresnoy</a> and
         <a id="place674" href="place-index.html?n=Mericourt, Croix-Fonsommes, France" title="Mericourt, Croix-Fonsommes, France">Mericourt</a>, our advance was slow,
         but was steadily pushed forward during the afternoon, and by 6 p.m., C Company,
         in touch with the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment on the right, were on the
         railway <abbr title="South-East">S.E.</abbr> of <a id="place675" href="place-index.html?n=Fresnoy-le-Grand, France" title="Fresnoy-le-Grand, France">Fresnoy</a>, A Company
         occupied the village, D Company in touch with the 1/4-th Leicestershire Regiment
         on the left along the railway cutting <abbr title="East">E.</abbr> of the village, while B Company remained in support on the <a id="place676">Beauregard</a>-<a id="place677" href="place-index.html?n=Mericourt, Croix-Fonsommes, France" title="Mericourt, Croix-Fonsommes, France">Mericourt</a> road.</p>

            G. Briggs</a>
         localised a machine gun, the fire of which was chiefly responsible for delaying
         the advance, and leading his section forward to a flank succeeded in knocking
         out the gun by his Lewis gun fire, and then, after reaching his own objective,
         by skilful handling of his gun succeeded in neutralising another enemy machine
         gun, which was holding up the company on his flank. He exhibited great coolness
         under fire, and displayed considerable initiative, and earned the Military
         Medal, which was also awarded to <a href="people-index.html#Hind, Robert Leonard, 242476" title="Hind, Robert Leonard, 242476" id="pers540">Private
            R. L.
            Hind</a> for conspicuous gallantry as a runner
         during the day, and to <a href="people-index.html#Conroy, Edwin, 241662" title="Conroy, Edwin, 241662" id="pers541">Private
            R. Conroy</a>,
         who, although himself wounded, continued to perform his duties as a stretcher
         bearer with marked gallantry. Our casualties were 12 wounded, and the enemy
         opposition during the day was practically confined to machine guns, and only
         small detachments were seen.</p>
      
      <p>At 6.30 p.m. the Battalion took over the whole Brigade frontage; C Company
         extended to the right, faking over the 1/5th Leicestershire frontage and 
         [<a id="p183" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/183/mode/1up">p183</a>]
          gaining touch with the 55th French Infantry;
         D Company extended to the left taking over the 1/4th Leicestershire frontage and
         gaining touch with the 6th Division on the left flank; picquets and patrols were
         pushed well forward. At 8.30 p.m. a readjustment of frontage was ordered, the
         French taking over on the right as far as <a id="place678" href="place-index.html?n=Fresnoy-le-Grand, France" title="Fresnoy-le-Grand, France">Fresnoy</a> railway station, but there was some delay in carrying this
         out as the 6th Division did not move till later; however, by 4.30 a.m. on the
         <span title="1918-10-10">10th</span>, the new line was occupied. At 5.45 a.
         m. our patrols reported Landricourt Wood clear of the enemy, and this
         information was passed to the French, who subsequently attacked the Bois
         D'Etaves from that direction. In co-operation with this advance our line was
         pushed forward, and at 9 a.m. on <span title="1918-10-10">October 10th</span> was
         established on the <a id="place679" href="place-index.html?n=Bohain-en-Vermandois, France" title="Bohain-en-Vermandois, France">Bohain</a>-<a id="place680" href="place-index.html?n=Seboncourt, France" title="Seboncourt, France">Seboncourt</a> road, with forward platoons from
         500 to 1, 000 yards in advance. At 12.30 p.m., the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment
         passed through our line, and continued the advance, the Battalion thus coming
         into support. At 5.30 p.m. the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment passed through,
         thus bringing the Battalion into reserve and our dispositions remained unchanged
         during the night. There was little or no opposition to the advance, although
         desultory enemy shelling caused a few casualties. At 7 a.m. on <span title="1918-10-11">October 11th</span> the Battalion was relieved by the
         1/6th North Stafford Regiment, and moved back into Divisional reserve in billets
         in <a id="place681" href="place-index.html?n=Fresnoy-le-Grand, France" title="Fresnoy-le-Grand, France">Fresnoy-le-Grand</a>.</p>
      
      <p>From <span title="1918-10-11">October 11th</span> to <span title="1918-10-16">16th</span> we rested in these billets, two hours' training being carried out
         each morning, and the afternoon being devoted to football and tug-of-war
         competitions. At 9.30 p.m. on <span title="1918-10-16">October 16th</span> the
         Battalion left <a id="place682" href="place-index.html?n=Fresnoy-le-Grand, France" title="Fresnoy-le-Grand, France">Fresnoy</a> to take up
         assembly positions for a further advance <span title="1918-10-17">next
            day</span>, A Company on the right 200 yards <abbr title="East">E.</abbr> of the 
         [<a id="p184" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/184/mode/1up">p184</a>]
         
         <a id="place683" href="place-index.html?n=Bohain-en-Vermandois, France" title="Bohain-en-Vermandois, France">Bohain</a>-<a id="place684" href="place-index.html?n=Vaux-Andigny, France" title="Vaux-Andigny, France">Vaux-Andigny</a> road, D Company prolonging the line to the left,
         with B and C Companies in support <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> of the road. The assembly positions were occupied at 3.30 a.m. on
         <span title="1918-10-17">October 17th</span>, the first objective of the
         attack being the village of <a id="place685" href="place-index.html?n=Vaux-Andigny, France" title="Vaux-Andigny, France">Vaux-
            Andigny</a>. At 4.30 a.m., the assembly positions were shelled and some
         casualties caused. Zero hour was 5.20 a.m. when the barrage opened and our
         troops moved forward in touch with the Essex Regiment (6th Division) on our left
         and the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment on our right. There was a very thick mist,
         nothing of the ground could be seen, and the advance had to be conducted by
         compass bearing, which had previously been taken on the objective.</p>
      
      <p>Two of the Battalion scouts, Privates <a href="people-index.html#Moore, Harold, 241664" title="Moore, Harold, 241664" id="pers542">H.
            Moore</a> and <a href="people-index.html#Ivatt, James Frederick, 242394" title="Ivatt, James Frederick, 242394" id="pers543">J. F. Ivatt</a>, did excellent work in
         assisting to lead the companies in the fog, and subsequently in locating hostile
         machine guns, and showed great courage and determination under heavy fire. Owing
         to the thick mist there was some inevitable loss of direction, but a general
         line was maintained. A trench in front of the village was found to be strongly
         held, and some close fighting took place, the trench being carried and a few
         prisoners and some machine guns captured. Our casualties were rather heavy and
         three officers were wounded, one of whom subsequently died of wounds.
         Subordinate leaders, however, rose to the occasion, and great courage and
         initiative was shown by several <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officers">N.C.O.'s</abbr> and men.</p>
      
      <p><a href="people-index.html#Wilson, Alfred, 201577" title="Wilson, Alfred, 201577" id="pers544">Corporal
            A. Wilson</a>,
         when his platoon officer and sergeant were both killed, took command of his Platoon, led it forward
         with skill and determination, and captured 2 machine guns and several prisoners:
         <a href="people-index.html#Clarke, Walter, 240343" title="Clarke, Walter, 240343" id="pers545">Sergeant
            W. Clarke</a>,
         when the platoons got somewhat disorganized in the fog, rendered very great
         service in organizing scattered bodies of men under heavy 
         [<a id="p185" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/185/mode/1up">p185</a>]

            S. J.
            Meanwell</a>, when all the <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officers">N.C.O.'s</abbr> in his platoon had become casualties, took command of the platoon, and
         led them forward with great ability. <a href="people-index.html#Jacklin, Alfred, 240667" title="Jacklin, Alfred, 240667" id="pers547">Corporal
            A. Jacklin</a>
         also did excellent work in collecting and organizing parties of men in the fog,
         and led his platoon forward with great gallantry, subsequently attacking and
         capturing an enemy machine gun.</p>
      
      <p>In spite of the fact that the mist continued, A Company on the right, brilliantly
         led by <a href="people-index.html#Nichols, John Sebastian, Capt" title="Nichols, John Sebastian, Capt" id="pers548">Captain
            J. S.
            Nichols</a>, although under heavy fire from
         Bellevue ridge, succeeded in reaching its objective, the <a id="place686" href="place-index.html?n=Andigny les Fermes, Vaux-Andigny, France" title="Andigny les Fermes, Vaux-Andigny, France">Andigny Les Fernes</a>-<a id="place687" href="place-index.html?n=Regnicourt, Vaux-Andigny, France" title="Regnicourt, Vaux-Andigny, France">Regnicourt</a> road just <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> of the former village. The left Company (D) losing direction, moved
         across the front and found itself in front of <a id="place688" href="place-index.html?n=Regnicourt, Vaux-Andigny, France" title="Regnicourt, Vaux-Andigny, France">Regnicourt</a> village, which it captured in conjunction with a
         company of the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment. B Company now moved up to replace
         D Company on the left of A, but could not get into the village of <a id="place689" href="place-index.html?n=Andigny les Fermes, Vaux-Andigny, France" title="Andigny les Fermes, Vaux-Andigny, France">Andigny Les Fernes</a> owing to heavy machine gun
         fire from the village and wood, and the barrage by this time had been lost. The
         6th Division on our left was also held up by machine gun fire, and our left
         flank being exposed was slightly withdrawn in order to keep touch. At 9 a. m.
         units of the 1st Division, passing through the 6th Division, cleared the
         Bellevue Ridge, and secured our left flank; the companies were reorganised for a
         further advance on <a id="place690" href="place-index.html?n=Andigny les Fermes, Vaux-Andigny, France" title="Andigny les Fermes, Vaux-Andigny, France">Andigny Les Fernes</a>,
         and the enemy resistance weakening, our line was established at 3.30 p.m. on the
         south side of the village, and strong points constructed under <abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr>, each being manned by a platoon with a Vickers gun.</p>
      
      <p>During the advance on <a id="place691" href="place-index.html?n=Andigny les Fermes, Vaux-Andigny, France" title="Andigny les Fermes, Vaux-Andigny, France">Andigny Les Femes</a>,
         <a href="people-index.html#Atkins, Thomas, 201495" title="Atkins, Thomas, 201495" id="pers549">Private
            T. Atkins</a> won
         the Distinguished Conduct Medal, when all the rest of his section having become
         casualties, he pushed on alone, having 
         [<a id="p186" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/186/mode/1up">p186</a>]
         
         located an enemy machine gun at the edge of the village, and by fire with his
         Lewis gun put it out of action; he was wounded, but continued to serve his gun
         until the objective was obtained. <a href="people-index.html#Stockdale, Percy, 242542" title="Stockdale, Percy, 242542" id="pers550">Lance-Corporal
            P. Stockdale</a>
         in the face of point blank fire from an enemy field gun firing from a wood
         beyond the objective made repeated attempts to dislodge two enemy machine guns,
         and by his courage and determination in attack at length enabled other troops to
         advance and silence them. <a href="people-index.html#Smalley, Ernest, 240638" title="Smalley, Ernest, 240638" id="pers551">Private
            E. Smalley</a>
         took command of the remainder of his section and having located an enemy machine
         gun worked round the position, attacked and captured the gun.</p>
      
      <p>Patrols were now sent forward along the <a id="place692" href="place-index.html?n=Mennevret, France" title="Mennevret, France">Menevret</a> road where it was hoped to gain touch with the French, but
         enemy machine gun fire prevented further movement in this direction. At dark, a
         company of 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment pushed through to explore in the same
         direction, but no advance was made until a late hour. At 5 p.m. the Battalion
         was relieved by two companies of the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment and moved
         into support in the sunken road and railway cutting. The day had been exacting,
         the enemy made a stubborn resistance, and each advance was only made after
         considerable fighting. Our casualties were rather heavy, three officers were
         wounded: 2nd Lieuts. <a href="people-index.html#Barton, Frederick Pembroke, 2nd Lt (d 1918)" title="Barton, Frederick Pembroke, 2nd Lt (d 1918)" id="pers552">

      <p>A party of prisoners was being conducted back by <a href="people-index.html#Towers, Joseph, 40677" title="Towers, Joseph, 40677" id="pers555">Private
            J. Towers</a> and
