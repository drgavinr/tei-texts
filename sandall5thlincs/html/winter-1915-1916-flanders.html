            </a> in command and with the assistance of several officers temporarily
         lent from other Battalions in the Brigade, the reorganization and re-equipment
         of the Battalion was begun, and steadily proceeded with during the next two
         days. A draft of 53 men was received, Company training, with route marching, was
         carried out daily, and at a church parade on the <span title="1915-10-24">24th</span> the <a href="people-index.html#Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" title="Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" id="pers818">Divisional Commander</a> inspected the Battalion and
         afterwards distributed cards of recognition to those to whom they had been
         awarded for conspicuous devotion to duty on the <span title="1915-10-13">13th</span>, and expressed his satisfaction with the gallant conduct of the
         Battalion, and his sympathy and regret at our heavy losses. On the same day a
         further draft of 50 men with five officers, Lieuts. <a href="people-index.html#Riggall, Harold Bertram, Maj" title="Riggall, Harold Bertram, Maj" id="pers182">

         the <span title="1915-10-28">28th</span> on the occasion of the inspection of
         units of the First Army by <a href="people-index.html#George V, King" title="George V, King" id="pers819">H.M. the King</a>, when the 138th Brigade was represented
         by a composite Battalion, we were just able to furnish the one complete Company
         required to represent the 1/5th Lincolnshire Regiment by bringing on parade the
         Transport Section, Quartermaster's staff, and a few men just returned 
         [<a id="p54" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/54/mode/1up">p54</a>]
          from hospital. It will be remembered that the
         review was marred by the serious accident to <a href="people-index.html#George V, King" title="George V, King" id="pers820">H.M. the King</a>, whose horse fell about
         ten minutes after he had passed the Battalion.</p>

         atrocious, permitted; by <span title="1915-11-04">November 4th</span> various
         drafts brought our total strength up to 446, and the Battalion was once more
         organised on the 4 Company basis. On <span title="1915-11-06">November 6th</span>
         the Battalion marched in Brigade through <a id="place194" href="place-index.html?n=Bethune, France" title="Bethune, France">Bethune</a> to <a id="place195" href="place-index.html?n=Robecq, France" title="Robecq, France">Robecq</a>, where
         much more comfortable billets were available, and a further draft of 70 men
         arrived, and on the <span title="1915-11-07">next day</span>

            C.
            Collinson</a>, who was appointed 2nd-in-Command, and
         eleven other officers joined, none of them Lincolnshire officers unfortunately,
         but all keen and prepared to work hard in the interests of their adopted
         Battalion, while on the <span title="1915-11-10">10th</span>, a draft of 171 men
         and 5 officers arrived from the 2/5th Lincolnshire Regiment in England. These
         reinforcements brought us practically up to establishment in officers, but still
         leaving us very much below strength in other ranks. The weather continued cold
         and wet, but steady training was carried on as far as possible in the sodden low
         lying fields round <a id="place196" href="place-index.html?n=Robecq, France" title="Robecq, France">Robecq</a> until the
         Division was once more called upon to take its place in the line.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1915-11-13">November 13th</span> the Battalion marched to
         <a id="place197" href="place-index.html?n=Saint-Venant, France" title="Saint-Venant, France">St. Venant</a>, <span title="1915-11-14">next day</span> to <a id="place198" href="place-index.html?n=Saint-Floris, France" title="Saint-Floris, France">Floris</a>, and on
         the <span title="1915-11-15">15th</span> to <a id="place199">Croix
            Barbée</a>, finding billets in some scattered and shell-shattered
         hovels; it rained all the way, the roads 
         [<a id="p55" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/55/mode/1up">p55</a>]
          were
         muddy and crowded with the Indian Divisions then leaving France, and the billets
         allotted for the Battalion only existed on the descriptions of them circulated
         by the Staff. The officers went up to reconnoitre the line of trenches in front
         of <a id="place200" href="place-index.html?n=Richebourg-Saint-Vaast, Richebourg, France" title="Richebourg-Saint-Vaast, Richebourg, France">Richebourg St. Vaast</a>, and on the
         <span title="1915-11-17">17th</span> the Battalion relieved the 1/6th North
         Staffordshire Regiment, being distributed with three Companies in the line, and
         one in support.</p>
      
      <p>The trenches were shallow, and indescribably muddy and wet; a jumbled mass of
         bricks and stone, with one solitary brick wall 100 yards behind marked the
         village; in front stretched some 300 yards of No Man's Land, a swamp crossed by
         numerous ditches, bank-high with muddy water. On the left front the black bulk
         of the Bois de Biez loomed through the mist about a quarter of a mile behind the
         line of mud, which marked the German parapet. The opposing artillery, blinded by
         the fog, rumbled but rarely, but the machine guns made the night hideous,
         particularly for those carrying rations and stores over the open, all
         communication trenches having been long since incorporated into the river system
         of the country.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1915-11-20">November 20th</span>, we were relieved, and returned
         to billets at <a id="place201">Croix Barbée</a>, moving
         <span title="1915-11-20">next day</span> to Rue de Chevattes, where the
         Battalion remained till the <span title="1915-11-24">24th</span>, supplying the
         usual working parties while out of trenches. On the evening of the <span title="1915-11-24">24th</span>, while Battalion Headquarters remained at Rue
         de Chevattes, the Battalion took over a line of trenches from Quinque Rue to
         Farm Cour d'Avoué, two Companies being in the line, one in support at Fuise Station,
         and one at Battalion
         Headquarters. On the <span title="1915-11-26">26th</span>, an inter-company
         relief took place, and meanwhile the weather changed and hard frost succeeded
         the rain, making the ground too hard to dig, but on the 
         [<a id="p56" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/56/mode/1up">p56</a>]
          other hand rendering locomotion easier, and enabling several
         derelict trenches to be occupied, as the water in them froze. The previous
         occupants had been much too engaged in fighting to think of safety and comfort,
         and the almost complete absence of dug-outs was keenly felt in a temperature
         approaching Zero Fahrenheit. Plenty of occupation was usually found by everyone
         in changing socks and oiling feet with a view to prevention of frost bite.</p>
      
      <p>After another inter-company relief on the <span title="1915-11-29">29th</span>, we
         were relieved by the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment on the <span title="1915-11-30">30th</span>, and marched back to billets at <a id="place203" href="place-index.html?n=Le Touret, La Couture, France" title="Le Touret, La Couture, France">Etouret</a>, which were not reached till 3.15 a.m.
         on <span title="1915-12-01">December 1st</span>. At this time the Battalion,
         cheerfully resigned to the prospect of a winter in Flanders, was roused suddenly
         to enthusiasm by the unexpected receipt of Orders at 3 a.m. on <span title="1915-12-03">December 3rd</span> that the Division would at once
         proceed to the East. During the day the 20 mile march was completed to
         <a id="place204" href="place-index.html?n=Le Sart, Merville, France" title="Le Sart, Merville, France">Le Sart</a>, a village <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> of <a id="place205" href="place-index.html?n=Merville, France" title="Merville, France">Merville</a>, where a halt of
         a fortnight's duration was enjoyed to allow the Division to concentrate, daily
         Company training and an occasional route march filling up the time. On the <span title="1915-12-14">14th</span> a number of officers proceeded to <a id="place206" href="place-index.html?n=Lillers, France" title="Lillers, France">Lillers</a> and <a id="place207" href="place-index.html?n=Berguette, Isbergues, France" title="Berguette, Isbergues, France">Berguette</a> to inspect the entraining arrangements at those
         stations, preparatory to the move to the East. On <span title="1915-12-19">December 19th</span>, the Battalion moved to new billets at <a id="place208" href="place-index.html?n=Thiennes, France" title="Thiennes, France">Thiennes</a>, near <a id="place209" href="place-index.html?n=Aire-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Aire-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais, France">Aire</a>, and for the next week training in open warfare was
         energetically carried out. The weather was now mild, and Christmas was spent by
         everyone in great comfort and some measure of good cheer, the distance from the
         "dykes", as the trenches were then colloquially termed, being
         sufficiently great to permit of this. A fund had been raised in Lincolnshire by
         <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Adelina (d 1932)" title="Sandall, Adelina (d 1932)" id="pers194">
            Mrs.
            Sandall</a>, the wife of the late <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers821">Commanding Officer</a>, to supply Christmas comforts to
         the Battalion 
         [<a id="p57" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/57/mode/1up">p57</a>]
          including plum puddings, and the
         receipt of these, together with supplies of cake, chocolate, and other
         comestibles, cigarettes, footballs, boxing gloves and so on, added greatly to
         the comfort and enjoyment of the men who greatly appreciated the kindness of
         their friends at home.</p>
      
      <p>After Christmas, training in open warfare was resumed, Battalion and Brigade
         schemes frequently carried out and outpost training assiduously practised. The
         long delay, however, caused some anxiety to those looking forward to a winter in
         Egypt, but at length on <span title="1916-01-04">January 4th, 1916</span>, the
         long expected and anxiously awaited orders to move arrived, and on <span title="1916-01-05">January 5th</span>, the Battalion marched at 9.30 a.m. to
         <a id="place210" href="place-index.html?n=Berguette, Isbergues, France" title="Berguette, Isbergues, France">Berguette</a>, where we entrained,
         leaving at 4.40 p.m. in high spirits at leaving the mud and cold of Flanders
         behind, with roseate visions of the East in our thoughts.</p>
