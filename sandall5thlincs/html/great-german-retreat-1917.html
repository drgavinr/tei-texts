      <h2>The Great German Retreat in 1917</h2>
      
      <p>It was common knowledge at the end of <span title="1917-02">February 1917</span>,
         that the Germans were preparing to retire to their new defensive position, the
         Hindenburg Line; increased artillery activity, frequent fires and explosions
         during the night and increased movement by day were all observed from our front
         trenches, and battalions holding the line were instructed to push patrols boldly
         forward, and if possible penetrate the old German front line. On becoming
         Brigade Reserve, we were warned to be ready to move at short notice, and all
         preparations were made. On the <span title="1917-02-25">25th</span>
         <a id="place385" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a> was heavily shelled
         during the morning, and orders were received warning the Battalion to be ready
         to move up at once in support, if our patrols were able to occupy any portion of
         the enemy line in the evening, but this was not found possible, and at 2 a.m.,
         we were notified accordingly. The <span title="1917-02-26">26th</span> was spent
         in constant expectation of an order to move, but again we were disappointed.
         <a href="people-index.html#Binns, Arthur Lennon, Capt" title="Binns, Arthur Lennon, Capt" id="pers262">Captain
            A. L.
            Binns</a> rejoined the Battalion, and resumed
         his appointment as Adjutant, <a href="people-index.html#Schiller, Louis Christian, Capt" title="Schiller, Louis Christian, Capt" id="pers263">
            Lieut.
            
            Schiller
            </a>, who had worthily filled his place since <span title="1916-10">October</span>, becoming Intelligence Officer. On the <span title="1917-02-27">27th</span> we relieved the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment in
         our sector during the morning, and in the evening we pushed forward strong
         patrols on the <a id="place386" href="place-index.html?n=Essarts, Bucquoy, France" title="Essarts, Bucquoy, France">Essarts</a> Road and to the
         Z trench, but these points were found to be strongly held by the enemy. However,
         on the morning of the <span title="1917-02-28">28th</span> we received
         information 
         [<a id="p106" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/106/mode/1up">p106</a>]
          that the battalion on our right,
         the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment, had occupied <a id="place387" href="place-index.html?n=Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France">Gommecourt</a> during the night without opposition, and in the
         afternoon two of our support platoons were detailed to dig a communication
         trench from our front line to <a id="place388" href="place-index.html?n=Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France">Gommecourt</a>, south of the <a id="place389" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a>-<a id="place390" href="place-index.html?n=Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France">Gommecourt</a> road. At dark a strong patrol under <a href="people-index.html#Schiller, Louis Christian, Capt" title="Schiller, Louis Christian, Capt" id="pers264">
            Lieut.
            Schiller
            </a> was again sent forward to the Z trench, but while endeavouring to
         pass through the German wire, heavy rifle fire was opened by the enemy, and
         <a href="people-index.html#Schiller, Louis Christian, Capt" title="Schiller, Louis Christian, Capt" id="pers265">
            Lieut.
            Schiller
            </a> was wounded, and the patrol compelled to retire. On <span title="1917-03-01">March 1st</span> three platoons were detailed to carry
         ammunition up to the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment, who were now occupying
         <a id="place391" href="place-index.html?n=Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France">Gommecourt</a>, and every other
         available man to complete the new communication trench south of the <a id="place392" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a>-<a id="place393" href="place-index.html?n=Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France">Gommecourt</a> road. A strong patrol under <a href="people-index.html#Perrott, Isambard Carlisle Anthony, Lt" title="Perrott, Isambard Carlisle Anthony, Lt" id="pers266">
            Lieut.
            Perrott</a>, which was supported by a platoon with a Lewis Gun, was again sent
         forward at dark, but found the Z trench still strongly held by the enemy, and
         patrols at 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. returned with the same information.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1917-03-02">March 2nd</span> the weather was very misty and the
         enemy line invisible, but patrols reported the position unchanged. In the
         evening detachments from two Companies were detailed to repair the road from
         <a id="place394" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a> to <a id="place395" href="place-index.html?n=Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France">Gommecourt</a>, and next morning we were relieved
         by the 1/7th Sherwood Foresters, and marched back to billets at <a id="place396" href="place-index.html?n=Saint-Amand, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Saint-Amand, Pas-de-Calais, France">St. Amand</a>, where the huts were very good, and
         the officers' billets also comfortable, a great contrast to <a id="place397" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a>. As no further advance of the
         Division appeared likely in the immediate future, a course of training was
         arranged especially in open warfare, night marching on compass bearing, trench
         attacks and so on, preparatory to our expected future operations, but a heavy
         fall of snow on <span title="1917-03-04">March 
            [<a id="p107" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/107/mode/1up">p107</a>]
            
            4th</span> and <span title="1917-03-05">5th</span> suspended training for a
         day or two, the Battalion being held in readiness to move at three hours'
         notice. The weather continued very cold but fine after the <span title="1917-03-06">6th</span>, and training was steadily carried out until
         the <span title="1917-03-10">10th</span>, a draft of 40 men reaching us on the
         <span title="1917-03-08">8th</span>. On the <span title="1917-03-11">11th</span> the whole Battalion were detailed for work under <abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr> in front of <a id="place398" href="place-index.html?n=Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France">Gommecourt</a>, and
         <a href="people-index.html#Tetley, Francis Eric, Lt-Col" title="Tetley, Francis Eric, Lt-Col" id="pers267">Major
            F. E.
            Tetley</a>, who had done invaluable work for
         the Battalion as 2nd-in-Command, left us to take command of the 1/4th
         Leicestershire Regiment. During the next few days large fatigue parties were
         required, two half Companies being left at work from 4 p.m. on the <span title="1917-03-12">12th</span> to 3 a.m. on the <span title="1917-03-13">13th</span>, a proceeding which led the <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers864">
            <abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr>
            </a> to protest to Brigade Headquarters against men being over-worked.</p>
      
      <p>The enemy's retreat had steadily proceeded, and on the <span title="1917-03-14">14th</span>, after a warning that the Battalion would shortly relieve a
         Battalion of the 139th Brigade, the officers reconnoitred the newly occupied
         territory up to Biez Wood. Training continued until the <span title="1917-03-17">17th</span>, when we received orders to relieve the 1/6th North
         Staffordshire Regiment in what was now our front line at 9 a.m. on the <span title="1917-03-18">18th</span>. Accordingly at 3 a.m. the Battalion marched
         out from <a id="place399" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a> in fighting order,
         via <a id="place400" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a>, where bombs were
         drawn, and Rettemoy Farm, where flares and other stores were issued, to
         Battalion Headquarters in the old German gun pits 500 yards <abbr title="South-East">S.E.</abbr> of <a id="place401" href="place-index.html?n=Essarts, Bucquoy, France" title="Essarts, Bucquoy, France">Essarts</a>. Relief was
         completed at 10 a.m., three companies being on a line from Daervillers Farm <abbr title="North">N.</abbr> of <a id="place402" href="place-index.html?n=Bucquoy, France" title="Bucquoy, France">Bucquoy</a> to 500 yards <abbr title="South-East">S.E.</abbr> of Quesnoy Farm. As
         <a id="place404" href="place-index.html?n=Ayette, France" title="Ayette, France">Ayette</a>, the village in our front,
         was reported unoccupied, two platoons of A Company pushed forward and occupied
         it, the line advanced, and Battalion Headquarters established on hill 155. At
         1.30 p.m. orders were received to push forward and hold 
         [<a id="p108" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/108/mode/1up">p108</a>]
          a line from <abbr title="North">N.</abbr> of <a id="place405" href="place-index.html?n=Ayette, France" title="Ayette, France">Ayette</a> to <abbr title="North">N.</abbr> of <a id="place406" href="place-index.html?n=Douchy-les-Ayette, France" title="Douchy-les-Ayette, France">Douchy</a>, the movement being
         completed at 5 p.m. and Battalion Headquarters established in <a id="place407" href="place-index.html?n=Ayette, France" title="Ayette, France">Ayette</a> without any opposition from the enemy,
         touch being obtained with the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment at <a id="place408" href="place-index.html?n=Douchy-les-Ayette, France" title="Douchy-les-Ayette, France">Douchy</a> on our left, and with the 7th Division
         at <a id="place409" href="place-index.html?n=Bucquoy, France" title="Bucquoy, France">Bucquoy</a> on our right. The advance
         over open country, although there was no actual fighting was a source of much
         excitement, and all ranks felt in the highest spirits at the first experience of
         open warfare after two years in the Field.</p>
      
      <p>Later in the evening we were ordered to push forward, one Company to hold the
         spur between <a id="place410" href="place-index.html?n=Ayette, France" title="Ayette, France">Ayette</a> and <a id="place411" href="place-index.html?n=Moyenneville, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Moyenneville, Pas-de-Calais, France">Moyenvillers</a>, and touch having been obtained
         at the latter village with the 7th Division, an out-post line was formed by two
         Companies for the night, the other two Companies and Battalion Headquarters
         being in <a id="place412" href="place-index.html?n=Ayette, France" title="Ayette, France">Ayette</a>. Next morning we
         continued to hold the line, while the 58th Division, on our left, advanced
         across our front to <a id="place413" href="place-index.html?n=Boiry-Becquerelle, France" title="Boiry-Becquerelle, France">Boiry</a> and
         <a id="place414" href="place-index.html?n=Boisleux-Saint-Marc, France" title="Boisleux-Saint-Marc, France">Boisleux</a>, and the 7th Division on
         our right advanced to <a id="place415" href="place-index.html?n=Boyelles, France" title="Boyelles, France">Boyelles</a>, thus
         squeezing us out of the front line; the position was maintained, however, until
         3 p.m. when we were relieved by the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment, and returned
         to billets for the night in the old German dug-outs in <a id="place416" href="place-index.html?n=Essarts, Bucquoy, France" title="Essarts, Bucquoy, France">Essarts</a> village. Great credit is due to the
         Transport under <a href="people-index.html#Linley, Hugh Banks, Capt" title="Linley, Hugh Banks, Capt" id="pers268">Lieut.
            H. B.
            Linley</a> for getting up rations and water
         during these two nights, as no wheeled traffic was possible, and everything was
         brought up on pack ponies.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1917-03-20">March 20th</span> the Battalion left <a id="place417" href="place-index.html?n=Essarts, Bucquoy, France" title="Essarts, Bucquoy, France">Essarts</a> and returned to <a id="place418" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a>, where a day's rest was enjoyed. The
         news that the 46th Division was to be temporarily withdrawn from the line, which
         in the ordinary way would have been greeted with enthusiasm, was on this
         occasion received with feelings 
         [<a id="p109" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/109/mode/1up">p109</a>]
          of great
         disappointment by all ranks, who were keenly anxious to take part in the British
         advance. However, we could only look forward to making good in an advance in
         another area, and the Battalion left <a id="place419" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a> on <span title="1917-03-22">March 22nd</span>, marching in
         cold and wet weather to <a id="place420" href="place-index.html?n=Bertrancourt, France" title="Bertrancourt, France">Bertrancourt</a>,
         where huts were available for the night: on the <span title="1917-03-23">23rd</span>, to <a id="place421" href="place-index.html?n=Beauquesne, Somme, Picardie, France" title="Beauquesne, Somme, Picardie, France">Bousquesne</a>, and on the
         <span title="1917-03-24">24th</span> to <a id="place422" href="place-index.html?n=Molliens-au-Bois, France" title="Molliens-au-Bois, France">Mulliens-au-Bois</a>, at both of which villages very comfortable
         billets were found. On <span title="1917-03-25">March 25th</span> we left
         <a id="place423" href="place-index.html?n=Molliens-au-Bois, France" title="Molliens-au-Bois, France">Mulliens-au-Bois</a> at 1 p.m.,
         marching nine miles to the <a id="place424" href="place-index.html?n=Doullens, France" title="Doullens, France">Doulens</a>-<a id="place425" href="place-index.html?n=Amiens, France" title="Amiens, France">Amiens</a> road,
         where we found motor-'buses in which we were carried via <a id="place426" href="place-index.html?n=Amiens, France" title="Amiens, France">Amiens</a> to <a id="place427" href="place-index.html?n=Longueau, France" title="Longueau, France">Longeau</a>, the Transport following by ordinary march route. We
         remained in fairly comfortable billets at <a id="place428" href="place-index.html?n=Longueau, France" title="Longueau, France">Longeau</a> for three days, and as officers and 20 per cent of men were
         daily given leave for <a id="place429" href="place-index.html?n=Amiens, France" title="Amiens, France">Amiens</a>, a large
         portion of the Battalion again enjoyed the sweets of civilization for a day.</p>
      
      <p>At 10.30 p.m. on the <span title="1917-03-27">27th</span> the Battalion left
         <a id="place430" href="place-index.html?n=Longueau, France" title="Longueau, France">Longeau</a>, and marched via the outer
         boulevards of <a id="place431" href="place-index.html?n=Amiens, France" title="Amiens, France">Amiens</a> to <a id="place432" href="place-index.html?n=Saleux, France" title="Saleux, France">Saleux</a> station, where we entrained for
         <a id="place433" href="place-index.html?n=Lillers, France" title="Lillers, France">Lillers</a>, at which station we were
         due to arrive at 7.30 a.m. on the <span title="1917-03-28">28th</span>. This
         programme however did not allow for the disorganization of traffic on the French
         railways at this period; progress was at a walking pace, with halts of uncertain
         duration about every quarter of a mile; near <a id="place434" href="place-index.html?n=Doullens, France" title="Doullens, France">Doullens</a> on one occasion we could count five trains ahead of us
         and three behind, with only about 50 yards interval between each train; we
         finally arrived at <a id="place435" href="place-index.html?n=Lillers, France" title="Lillers, France">Lillers</a> at 11 p.m.,
         a large proportion of the men having walked by the side of the train for a
         considerable portion of the journey, and marched to <a id="place436" href="place-index.html?n=Bourecq, France" title="Bourecq, France">Bourecq</a>, where good billets were found for the night, moving
         <span title="1917-03-29">next day</span> to <a id="place437" href="place-index.html?n=Palfart, France" title="Palfart, France">Febrin-Palfart</a>. We had now arrived in another training area,
         the Division forming part of 
         [<a id="p110" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/110/mode/1up">p110</a>]
          the II Corps in
         the First Army, and the Corps Commander, <a href="people-index.html#Jacob, Claud William, Lt-Gen" title="Jacob, Claud William, Lt-Gen" id="pers269">Lieut.-General
            Sir
            J. Jacob</a>, met
         all officers at Brigade Headquarters <span title="1917-03-30">next day</span>,
         when a redistribution of billets was made, one Company having to move to
         <a id="place438" href="place-index.html?n=Pippemont, Palfart, France" title="Pippemont, Palfart, France">Pippemont</a>, 1½ miles away, to make
         room in the village for Brigade Headquarters who coveted and subsequently took
         as their own, as was the way of superior authorities, the chateau which had been
         selected as Battalion Headquarters.</p>
      
      <p>As far as weather permitted, a strenuous training programme was now begun, but
         frequent blizzards caused a good deal of interference. A Brigade inter-Company
         football competition for a cup given by the <a href="people-index.html#Kemp, Geoffrey Chicheley, Brig-Gen" title="Kemp, Geoffrey Chicheley, Brig-Gen" id="pers865">Brigadier</a> was arranged, and on the <span title="1917-04-07">7th</span>, A Company beat B in the Battalion final, which
         was played late in the afternoon after a strenuous day's training lasting from
         breakfast at 7.30 a.m. till 4 p.m., the <a href="people-index.html#Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" title="Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" id="pers866"><abbr title="General Officer Commanding">G.O.C.</abbr> Division</a> having chosen this particular day to supervise our
         performance personally, and insisting on a repetition at 1.30 p.m. when we had
         planned to return to billets. On the <span title="1917-04-09">9th</span> a
         Divisional route march was carried out, units being inspected on the march by

         houses, all lately vacated by the enemy, who held a line approximately 400 yards

      <p>Heavy shelling at intervals during the next two days and nights was experienced,
         the neighbourhood of Battalion Headquarters, which was in an old German Brigade

         frequently going out by day and night under heavy shell fire, to restore the

            April</span>, especially on the <span title="1917-04-20">20th</span>, when,
         having carried in a wounded comrade, he went out again under a heavy barrage and
         succeeded in repairing a broken line. The Military Medal was also awarded to

            C. Gill</a>, who
         was in charge of the stretcher bearers during this period; he continually
         exposed himself to heavy fire, while attending to wounded, and showed great
         coolness and resource in his skilful handling of his section in bringing in
         wounded from the line to the Aid Post by the best route in the shortest possible
         time.</p>
      
      <p>In the early morning of <span title="1917-04-23">April 23rd</span>, in order to
         support an attack by the 139th Brigade on Hill 65 on our right, the Battalion
         was ordered to push forward strong patrols towards <a id="place456">Cité St. Elizabeth</a>, and three patrols, each consisting of a
         bombing section supported by the remainder of the platoon, went forward at 4.45
         a.m. but were all met by heavy rifle and machine gun fire from houses in front,
         and compelled to retire. One patrol under <a href="people-index.html#Major, John, 240769" title="Major, John, 240769" id="pers279">Corporal

         one of this patrol, also won the Military Medal for gallantry, volunteering to
         carry a message to our lines during the day, which involved crossing two roads
         which were swept by machine gun fire; he succeeded in doing so, and moreover
         returned to his patrol with an answer.</p>

         supporting another patrol, also exhibited great personal courage, skill and
         initiative by arranging covering fire for the withdrawal of the patrol, and
         succeeded by skilful leadership and keeping firm control of his command in
         getting the whole back to our line without casualty, and was also awarded the
         Military Medal.</p>
      
      <p>On the night of the <span title="1917-04-23">23rd</span>, after a very strenuous
         four days in the unaccustomed circumstances of fighting among houses and streets
         which concealed nests of enemy machine guns, a very different proposition to
         trenches in open country, the Battalion was relieved by the 1/4th Lincolnshire
         Regiment, and withdrew as Brigade Reserve to cellars in <a id="place457">Cité St. Pierre</a>. Next morning, however, sudden
         orders were received to relieve the 1/5th South Staffordshire Regiment in the
         sector on our right, the same evening; relief was completed at 2 a.m. on the
         <span title="1917-04-25">25th</span>, our dispositions being one Company in a
         series of posts in <a id="place458">Cité St. Theodore</a>, a <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> suburb of <a id="place459" href="place-index.html?n=Lens, France" title="Lens, France">Lens</a>, with one

         Headquarters and two Companies in reserve in <a id="place460" href="place-index.html?n=Lievin, France" title="Lievin, France">Lievin</a>. On the evening of the <span title="1917-04-26">26th</span>,
         the two front line Companies were relieved by two Companies of the 1/4th
         Lincolnshire Regiment, and the whole Battalion were then quartered in cellars in
         <a id="place461" href="place-index.html?n=Lievin, France" title="Lievin, France">Lievin</a>. The <span title="1917-04-27">27th</span> and <span title="1917-04-28">28th</span> were spent in interior

          and cleaning, and tubs collected
         from various cellars abandoned by the Germans were utilised as baths by the
         majority of the men. The area was shelled occasionally, but good cover was
         available, and there were no casualties.</p>
      
      <p>On the evening of the <span title="1917-04-29">29th</span> we relieved the 1/4th
         Lincolnshire Regiment in the line, and during the night pushed forward patrols
         up to the railway junction east of <a id="place462">Cité St.
            Theodore</a>, the whole of which was thus occupied by us. The night
         was quiet on our immediate front, although there was heavy shelling on our
         right, and Battalion Headquarters suffered heavily at noon <span title="1917-04-30">next day</span>.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1917-05-01">May 1st</span> the Battalion was withdrawn to occupy
         another sector in front of <a id="place463" href="place-index.html?n=Loos-en-Gohelle, France" title="Loos-en-Gohelle, France">Loos</a>,
         Battalion Headquarters being in Harrison's Crater, with two Companies in the
         line, and two in support; the Germans had not withdrawn on this part of the
         line, and consequently we were once again in a definite trench system, which had
         been rendered very indefinite, however, by long continued mine warfare.</p>

      <p>On <span title="1917-05-15">May 15th</span> the Battalion once more went into the
         line, relieving the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment 
         [<a id="p117" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/117/mode/1up">p117</a>]
          in the left <a id="place469" href="place-index.html?n=Lievin, France" title="Lievin, France">Lievin</a> sector, a line of
         trenches between the <a id="place470" href="place-index.html?n=Grenay, France" title="Grenay, France">Grenay</a>-<a id="place471" href="place-index.html?n=Lens, France" title="Lens, France">Lens</a> railway and the <a id="place472" href="place-index.html?n=Lievin, France" title="Lievin, France">Lievin</a>-<a id="place473" href="place-index.html?n=Lens, France" title="Lens, France">Lens</a> road, with an outpost line in <a id="place474">Cité St. Theodore</a>, 2½ Companies being in the front line, and 1½
         Companies in support in <a id="place475" href="place-index.html?n=Lievin, France" title="Lievin, France">Lievin</a>.</p>
      
      <p>Repeated warnings had been received from Brigade Headquarters that patrolling
         must be very active, as the enemy were expected to evacuate <a id="place476" href="place-index.html?n=Lens, France" title="Lens, France">Lens</a> at any moment, but it became increasingly
         evident that the great German retreat was nearing its end, and that the enemy
         intended to hold on to the positions he now occupied, unless attacked in force,
         and German patrols were active in feeling for the position of our outpost line.
         On the night of the <span title="1917-05-17">17th</span> a strong enemy patrol of
         20 or 30 approached one of our advanced posts, but were fortunately observed;
         <a href="people-index.html#Warren, Fred, 240216" title="Warren, Fred, 240216" id="pers294">Sergeant
            F. Warren</a>,
         who was in charge of the post, reserved his fire until the enemy were only 25
         yards away, and then opened fire on the patrol, who fled at once leaving one dead
         man, of the 118th Regiment, thus furnishing us with a valuable
         identification. Another identification was also obtained on the same night by
         <a href="people-index.html#Rawson, George Percy, 241626" title="Rawson, George Percy, 241626" id="pers295">Private
            G. P.
            Rawson</a>, who accompanied by another
         man, was visiting our advanced posts as a connecting patrol. The two men
         were attacked with bombs by a patrol of six Germans and both wounded, but
         <a href="people-index.html#Rawson, George Percy, 241626" title="Rawson, George Percy, 241626" id="pers296">
            Private
            Rawson
            </a> at once fired at his opponents, killed two, and charged at the
         others with his bayonet. The enemy fled, and <a href="people-index.html#Rawson, George Percy, 241626" title="Rawson, George Percy, 241626" id="pers297">
            Private
            Rawson
            </a> was awarded the Military Medal for conspicuous gallantry in
         attacking an enemy party, when himself wounded, and with odds against him. The
         two men killed proved to belong to the 35th Regiment.</p>
      
      <p>On the <span title="">18th</span>, we were relieved by the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment,
         and went back as Brigade Reserve to <a id="place477" href="place-index.html?n=Lievin, France" title="Lievin, France">Lievin</a>, finding strong working parties for the next 
         [<a id="p118" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/118/mode/1up">p118</a>]
          few nights, and on the <span title="">21st</span> we
         again took over the front line, with instructions that a Company raid was to be
         carried out during the tour, which were subsequently cancelled owing to a gas
         attack on the <a id="place478">Cité St. Laurent</a> front.
         The tour passed comparatively quietly, but there was considerable artillery
         activity, especially on the <span title="">24th</span>, when the 137th Brigade on our
         left, attacked Nash Alley in the <a id="place479" href="place-index.html?n=Loos-en-Gohelle, France" title="Loos-en-Gohelle, France">Loos</a>
         sector. On the evening of the <span title="">25th</span> we were relieved and again
         returned to <a id="place480" href="place-index.html?n=Sains-en-Gohelle, France" title="Sains-en-Gohelle, France">Petite Sains</a> as Divisional
         Reserve.</p>
