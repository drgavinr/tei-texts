      <h2>Trenches During The Winter of 1917-18</h2>
      
      <p>On <span title="1917-11-27">November 27th</span> a general cleaning up was
         undertaken, and the Battalion marched to rest billets in the Tobacco Factory in
         <a id="place542" href="place-index.html?n=Bethune, France" title="Bethune, France">Bethune</a>. The <span title="1917-11-28">28th</span> was spent in cleaning up and refitting;

         arranged, together with boxing contests and football as recreational training.
         On the <span title="1917-11-30">30th</span> the Battalion beat the 138th Brigade
         Headquarters in the Divisional League by 2 to 1. <a id="place543" href="place-index.html?n=Bethune, France" title="Bethune, France">Bethune</a> was shelled at intervals of a day or two, but we
         sustained no casualties. On <span title="1917-12-03">December 3rd</span> the

      <p>On <span title="1917-12-09">December 9th</span> about 5 p.m. <a href="people-index.html#Goodall, Charles Eric Griffiths, Capt" title="Goodall, Charles Eric Griffiths, Capt" id="pers455">
            Captain
            Goodall</a>, of C Company, observed a party of the enemy about 30 strong,
         getting out of their trenches and lying down in No Man's Land, and at 5.15 a
         heavy trench mortar bombardment began which gradually increased in intensity,
         forming a "box" on the area on the top of Railway Alley, with
         the rear side about 50 yards in front of our Reserve Line. <a href="people-index.html#Goodall, Charles Eric Griffiths, Capt" title="Goodall, Charles Eric Griffiths, Capt" id="pers456">

         barrage was put down, and all possible supporting fire was brought to bear on
         the front of the suspected raid, and as a result no enemy infantry attack
         ensued. It seems clear that the enemy intended a raid, which was stopped by the
         ready action of our artillery on <a href="people-index.html#Goodall, Charles Eric Griffiths, Capt" title="Goodall, Charles Eric Griffiths, Capt" id="pers457">

      <p>The <span title="1917-12-10">next day</span> passed quietly, but at 12.50 a.m. on
         <span title="1917-12-11">December 11th</span>, the enemy suddenly projected
         gas on to our front and reserve lines, principally on the right, with a
         simultaneous heavy artillery and trench mortar barrage which extended to the
         Battalion on our flanks. The projection was a complete surprise being the first
         occasion on which the Germans used projectors on the British Front; the
         projectors were apparently fired in four groups of about 100 each. The
         casualties were not so serious as might have been expected, <a href="people-index.html#Stevens, Gorham Vinton, Lt (d 1918)" title="Stevens, Gorham Vinton, Lt (d 1918)" id="pers460">
            2nd Lieut.
            Stevens
            </a> and 8 other ranks were gassed, of whom two afterwards died. During
         the day the damage done to our trenches by the bombardment was repaired, and at
         8.30 p.m. gas was successfully projected from our front line to which no
         immediate reply was made, but at 10 p.m. the enemy put down a heavy barrage on
         our front, and that of the Battalion on our right. At 11.35 p.m. an enemy party
         of 8 men attempted to raid one of our posts. <a href="people-index.html#Vassey, William, 43422" title="Vassey, William, 43422" id="pers461">Corporal
            W. Vassey</a> who

            W. Robinson</a>
         rushed forward and took up a position on the top, and opened fire with his Lewis
         gun. All three had behaved with great coolness and gallantry during the
         bombardment on the previous night, and were awarded the Military Medal. The
         enemy bombardment continued until 1.30 a.m. on the <span title="1917-12-13">13th</span>, when it died gradually away, and all available men set to work to
         repair our trenches which were badly damaged, our casualties being <a href="people-index.html#Mitchell, 2nd Lt" title="Mitchell, 2nd Lt" id="pers464">

          action during the night, when engaged in
         firing a Stokes Mortar. He noticed that the lever of one of the Stokes bombs had
         been knocked off, thereby causing the fuse to burn, and realised that in 12
         seconds the bomb would explode. He placed it in the mortar with the intention of
         firing it at the enemy but the cartridge misfired, and the bomb remained in the
         mortar with the fuse burning. In order to avoid an explosion, which would have
         wrecked the mortar, endangered the lives of other men, and probably destroyed
         the emplacement, as 300 detonated bombs were close at hand, <a href="people-index.html#Gross, Harry, 240675" title="Gross, Harry, 240675" id="pers466">
            Private
            Gross
            </a> quickly raised the base of the mortar, and catching the bomb as it
         slid from the muzzle, threw it out of the emplacement, when it immediately
         exploded. For this gallant action he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct
         Medal, and afterwards the Croix de Guerre.</p>
      
      <p>The next few days passed quietly, and on the evening of the <span title="1917-12-14">14th</span> we were relieved by the 1/4th Lincolnshire
         Regiment and went into Brigade support, Headquarters and two Companies at

         night working parties were employed in digging cable trenches; two football
         matches were played, when the Battalion beat the 138th <abbr title="Machine Gun Corps">M.G.C.</abbr> by 12 to 0, and the 465th Company <abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr> by 2 to 1; intimation was received that the Battalion Transport was

          quiet, but a heavy trench mortar
         and artillery barrage was put down on the centre Company, causing some
         casualties and damage. About 11.30 a small party of the enemy attempted to raid
         one of our posts, but were driven off by our fire. <a href="people-index.html#Reynolds, William H, 9350" title="Reynolds, William H, 9350" id="pers476">Private

         news from the front line to Company Headquarters owing to the heavy barrage; he
         patrolled the whole of his Company front above ground and then reported the
         situation to his Company Commander, and later
         worked for five hours under heavy machine gun fire to rescue two men who had
         been buried. <a href="people-index.html#Phelps, Herbert W, 1054" title="Phelps, Herbert W, 1054" id="pers477">Private

      <p>The enemy were inactive after this until the <span title="1918-01-06">6th</span>,
         which was marked by a long continuous bombardment on our front until 6 p.m.,
         causing considerable damage but no casualties. The weather continued cold, with
         snow at intervals, and on the <span title="1918-01-07">7th</span> we returned to
         Brigade support at <a id="place548" href="place-index.html?n=Annequin, France" title="Annequin, France">Annequin</a>, finding
         wiring parties and other fatigues during the next week until we returned to the

         trenches became impassable and food had to be conveyed to the front line at
         night over the top. A terrible thunderstorm occurred during the night and steady
         rain fell all <span title="1918-01-16">next day</span>. On the <span title="1918-01-17">17th</span>, as it was found impossible with the men
         available to clear the trenches, two companies of our Pioneer 
         [<a id="p155" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/155/mode/1up">p155</a>]
          Battalion, the 1st Monmouthshire Regiment, were sent to our
         assistance. The Division was now being withdrawn from the line for a time, being
         relieved by the 11th Division, and we were expecting to be relieved in the
         trenches by the 6th York and Lancaster Regiment in a few day's time. Owing to
         the bad weather, however, and the awful condition of the trenches our tour was
         shortened, and the Battalion were only too pleased to be relieved on the night
         of <span title="1918-01-17">January 17th</span> by the 1/4th Lincolnshire
         Regiment, and proceeded to billets at <a id="place549" href="place-index.html?n=Beuvry, France" title="Beuvry, France">Beuvry</a>. The rest from the line was very welcome, as the sector was
         by no means a quiet one, our casualties had been numerous, the weather for the
         past few weeks atrocious, the work very heavy, and the strain on the health of
         the men severe.</p>
