      <h2>The Winter of 1916-1917</h2>
      
      <p>The march to <a id="place334" href="place-index.html?n=Halloy, France" title="Halloy, France">Halloy</a> on the evening of
         <span title="1916-10-30">October 30th</span> was conducted in silence for the
         first few miles, as we had no wish to notify our departure to the enemy, but the
         men were then encouraged to sing, and as each platoon sang a different tune,
         hymns, sentimental songs, and facetious ditties being chosen impartially in
         turn, the resulting harmony was interesting. The weather broke during the march,
         and the Battalion arrived at their billets wet through, but in excellent
         spirits, at 10.30 p.m. <span title="1916-10-31">Next day</span> was a complete
         rest, but on <span title="1916-11-01">November 1st</span> the march was continued
         to <a id="place335" href="place-index.html?n=Bealcourt, France" title="Bealcourt, France">Bealcourt</a> in fine weather: starting
         at 8 a.m., we had a two-hours' halt at mid-day, when dinners were cooked and
         eaten by the roadside, and the 14 miles was completed at 4 p.m. On the <span title="1916-11-02">2nd</span> a 10-mile march in Brigade was finished at 3
         p.m., and the Battalion billeted at <a id="place336" href="place-index.html?n=Coulonvillers, France" title="Coulonvillers, France">Coulonvillers</a> for the night; the <span title="1916-11-03">next
            day</span>'s march of nine miles brought us to <a id="place337" href="place-index.html?n=Agenvillers, France" title="Agenvillers, France">Argenvillers</a>, where excellent billets were available, in which
         we remained for the next ten days. After such a long spell of trenches marching
         proved rather a trial to the men, and sore feet were very common, although it
         was made a point of honour to complete the day's march, and not fall out; the
         band was a great help during this march.</p>
      
      <p>We had now reached the area in which the Division was to rest, but the so-called
         rest was in reality a period of very strenuous training. <span title="1916-11-04">November 4th</span> was devoted to kit inspection and interior economy, 
         [<a id="p94" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/94/mode/1up">p94</a>]
          but the course of training began <span title="1916-11-05">next day</span> with three hours' close order drill after
         a Battalion church parade. The details of the training need not be described,
         but it was practically all training for open warfare, special attention being
         given to night operations, marching on compass bearing, bayonet fighting, and
         the practice of the attack by day and night. In addition a strenuous programme
         of "recreational" training was arranged, each Battalion had
         its inter-platoon football competition, while an inter-Battalion Divisional
         competition for a cup presented by the <a href="people-index.html#Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" title="Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" id="pers845">
            <abbr title="General Officer Commanding">G.O.C.</abbr>
            </a> was keenly contested; cross-country running and boxing contests were also
         arranged.</p>
      
      <p>Divisional Headquarters were at <a id="place338" href="place-index.html?n=Saint-Riquier, France" title="Saint-Riquier, France">St.
            Riquier</a>, a few miles from <a id="place339" href="place-index.html?n=Abbeville, Somme, Picardie, France" title="Abbeville, Somme, Picardie, France">Abbeville</a>, and many officers and men took advantage of the
         opportunity of being within reach of shops and the amenities of civilization, as
         a day's leave was granted to all in turn. The training programme was a very full
         one, and it hardly seemed to be realised by the Staffs of Higher Formations that
         the men did really require some physical rest; the <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers846"><abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> Battalion</a> on more than one occasion was compelled to protest
         that the men were really being over-worked, and to ask for some relaxation in
         the hours of work. On <span title="1916-11-11">November 11th</span> we changed
         our billets, proceeding to <a id="place340" href="place-index.html?n=Le Plessiel, Drucat, France" title="Le Plessiel, Drucat, France">La Plessiel</a>,
         a village about three miles nearer to <a id="place341" href="place-index.html?n=Abbeville, Somme, Picardie, France" title="Abbeville, Somme, Picardie, France">Abbeville</a>, where we found comfortable billets for the remainder of
         our "rest". On the <span title="1916-11-12">12th</span> a
         Brigade church parade was held, a reminiscence of the days of training in
         England, but on this occasion followed by three hours' work in close order
         drill! The Brigade Boxing competition was held on the <span title="1916-11-18">18th</span> and the Battalion was very successful. On the <span title="1916-11-20">20th</span> the training finished with a very strenuous
         day's work, the morning being devoted to practising the Battal
         [<a id="p95" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/95/mode/1up">p95</a>]
         ion in attack, with Brigade night operations after dark, the
         Brigade forming up in mass, marching over open country on a compass bearing, and
         finally deploying in artillery formation. The Battalion did not get back to
         billets until nearly 10 p.m., and only a short night's rest was possible, as we
         left <a id="place342" href="place-index.html?n=Le Plessiel, Drucat, France" title="Le Plessiel, Drucat, France">La Plessiel</a> at 7.15 a.m. next
         morning, marching about ten miles to <a id="place343" href="place-index.html?n=Domqueur, France" title="Domqueur, France">Domqueur</a>, where excellent billets were found, on our way back to
         the front.</p>
      
      <p>The duties of Adjutant were performed during the whole of the training by
         <a href="people-index.html#Schiller, Louis Christian, Capt" title="Schiller, Louis Christian, Capt" id="pers242">Lieut.
            L. C.
            Schiller</a>, in the absence of <a href="people-index.html#Binns, Arthur Lennon, Capt" title="Binns, Arthur Lennon, Capt" id="pers243">Captain
            A. L.
            Binns</a>, who had been obliged to go sick at
         the end of <span title="1916-10">October</span>, and was subsequently invalided
         to England. <a href="people-index.html#Schiller, Louis Christian, Capt" title="Schiller, Louis Christian, Capt" id="pers244">
            Lieut.
            Schiller
            </a> was therefore now officially gazetted as Adjutant and fulfilled the
         duties with conspicuous success until the return of <a href="people-index.html#Binns, Arthur Lennon, Capt" title="Binns, Arthur Lennon, Capt" id="pers245">
            Captain
            Binns
            </a> in <span title="1917-02">February, 1917</span>.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1916-11-23">November 23rd</span>, the march to the Front was
         resumed; leaving <a id="place344" href="place-index.html?n=Domqueur, France" title="Domqueur, France">Domqueur</a> at 7.15 a.m.,
         we reached <a id="place345" href="place-index.html?n=Bonnieres, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Bonnieres, Pas-de-Calais, France">Bonnieres</a> at 3 p.m. to find
         very crowded billets, where we remained over the <span title="1916-11-24">next
            day</span>, which was spent in cleaning and rest. On the <span title="1916-11-25">25th</span>, we left <a id="place346" href="place-index.html?n=Bonnieres, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Bonnieres, Pas-de-Calais, France">Bonnieres</a> at 9 a.m. in pouring rain, which continued until at 2
         p.m. we reached <a id="place347" href="place-index.html?n=Halloy, France" title="Halloy, France">Halloy</a>, the village
         where we had rested on our first night out of the trench area. Everyone was wet
         through, the billets were bad and very crowded, but the depression of spirits
         produced by these conditions was quickly dispelled by the fine weather and
         complete rest which the <span title="1916-11-26">next day</span> gave. The
         <span title="1916-11-27">27th</span> to <span title="1916-11-29">29th</span> were spent in
         training in the rather limited area available, and the <span title="1916-11-30">30th</span> was devoted to the Divisional Cross-country run. A course of
         about three miles was marked out, and every officer and man who completed the
         run in 25 minutes scored one point for his unit. The unit scoring the greatest
         number of points in proportion to its strength won the competition. Five hundred
         
         [<a id="p96" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/96/mode/1up">p96</a>]
          and fifty of the Battalion turned out for
         the run, but owing to an unfortunate mistake on the way to the starting point,
         some sixty arrived too late to start; however, 167 finished within the shedule
         time, and we took 6th place out of 13 competing units.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1916-12-01">December 1st</span> the Battalion, after a morning's
         practice, paraded at 1.45 p.m. for a ceremonial inspection by the <a href="people-index.html#Snow, Thomas D'Oyly, Lt-Gen" title="Snow, Thomas D'Oyly, Lt-Gen" id="pers847"><abbr title="General Officer Commanding">G.O.C.</abbr> VII. Corps</a>, who was accompanied by the <a href="people-index.html#Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" title="Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" id="pers848"><abbr title="General Officer Commanding">G.O.C.</abbr> 46th Division</a>. The inspection was of the usual type,
         beginning with a general salute, and ending with a march past, and advance in
         review order, and passed off very successfully, a complimentary order being
         issued in the evening by the <a href="people-index.html#Snow, Thomas D'Oyly, Lt-Gen" title="Snow, Thomas D'Oyly, Lt-Gen" id="pers849">Corps Commander</a>, congratulating the Division and
         Brigade on the appearance and steadiness of the Battalion. After the inspection
         the <a href="people-index.html#Snow, Thomas D'Oyly, Lt-Gen" title="Snow, Thomas D'Oyly, Lt-Gen" id="pers850">Corps
            Commander</a> presented Military Medal ribands to eight men of the
         Battalion who had recently been awarded the medal. The only drawback to the
         success of the afternoon's proceedings was the bitterly cold piercing wind,
         which made the return to the shelter of billets very welcome. On <span title="1916-12-02">December 2nd</span>, the morning was spent in fitting the
         Battalion out with new Box Respirators, while the <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers851">
            <abbr title="Commanding Officer">C.O.</abbr></a>, <a href="people-index.html#Schiller, Louis Christian, Capt" title="Schiller, Louis Christian, Capt" id="pers852">Adjutant</a>, and
         Company Commanders travelled by 'bus to <a id="place348" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a>, and then walked up to <a id="place349" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a> to reconnoitre the sector to be taken over on the
         <span title="1916-12-05">5th</span>, which was not identical with that we had
         occupied in <span title="1916-06">June</span>, although the Battalion
         Headquarters were the same.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1916-12-05">December 5th</span> the Battalion marched by Platoons
         from <a id="place350" href="place-index.html?n=Halloy, France" title="Halloy, France">Halloy</a> through <a id="place351" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a> to relieve the 8th West Yorkshire
         Regiment in the trenches between the <a id="place352" href="place-index.html?n=La Brayelle, Bucquoy, France" title="La Brayelle, Bucquoy, France">La
            Brayelle</a> and <a id="place353" href="place-index.html?n=Essarts, Bucquoy, France" title="Essarts, Bucquoy, France">Essarts</a> Roads,
         the relief being completed by 2 p.m., three companies being in the line and one
         company in dug-outs at 
         [<a id="p97" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/97/mode/1up">p97</a>]
          Battalion Headquarters
         at <a id="place354" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a>. The trenches were
         very muddy and wet, and proper stores for bombs and ammunition conspicuous by
         their absence, and it was evident that much hard work would be required: the
         advanced trench, dug in <span title="1916-06">June</span>, had been abandoned,
         but an intermediate trench was now held as the front line, while the original
         front line was now the support line. About 9 p.m. on the <span title="1916-12-06">6th</span>, when a patrol under <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Robert Edward Wychenford, Lt" title="Sandall, Robert Edward Wychenford, Lt" id="pers246">Lieut.
            R. E.
            W.
            Sandall</a>, the Intelligence Officer, went out to
         reconnoitre No Man's Land, they were surprised by a German party lying in wait
         on the <a id="place355" href="place-index.html?n=Hannescamps, France" title="Hannescamps, France">Hannescamp</a>-<a id="place356" href="place-index.html?n=Essarts, Bucquoy, France" title="Essarts, Bucquoy, France">Essarts</a> Road, who opened fire on our patrol at
         close range, and also bombed them heavily. <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Robert Edward Wychenford, Lt" title="Sandall, Robert Edward Wychenford, Lt" id="pers247">
            Lieut.
            Sandall
            </a> was wounded, and our patrol retired with <a href="people-index.html#Wenham, William Albert, 240601" title="Wenham, William Albert, 240601" id="pers853">one
            man</a> missing. A strong patrol was immediately sent to the scene of the
         affair, but no trace of the German party or <a href="people-index.html#Wenham, William Albert, 240601" title="Wenham, William Albert, 240601" id="pers854">our
            missing man</a> could be found. On the same evening a sentry in the line
         reported to <a href="people-index.html#Hall, John William, 240195" title="Hall, John William, 240195" id="pers248">Sergt.
            J. W.
            Hall</a> that he had seen six men enter our
         trenches some distance to his flank. <a href="people-index.html#Hall, John William, 240195" title="Hall, John William, 240195" id="pers249">
            Sergt.
            Hall</a>, first sending one man to his Platoon Commander with the
         information, ran along the trench accompanied by <a href="people-index.html#Wilkinson, John, 241338" title="Wilkinson, John, 241338" id="pers250">Private
            J. Wilkinson</a>,
         saw the party to be Germans, and attacked them, killing one, and wounding
         others, cleared the trench and obtained in addition a valuable identification,
         as the <a href="people-index.html#Roehrig, Gefreiter" title="Roehrig, Gefreiter" id="pers855">dead man</a>
         was found to belong to the 77th Reserve Infantry Regiment. Both <a href="people-index.html#Hall, John William, 240195" title="Hall, John William, 240195" id="pers251">
            Sergt.
            Hall
            </a> and <a href="people-index.html#Wilkinson, John, 241338" title="Wilkinson, John, 241338" id="pers252">
            Private
            Wilkinson
            </a> were awarded the Military Medal.</p>
      
      <p>These two incidents on one night showed that the Germans had apparently been
         allowed to attain the superiority in the No Man's Land between the lines in this
         sector, and orders were at once issued by the <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers856"><abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> Battalion</a> that the greatest boldness was to be exhibited by
         our patrols at night in order to obtain that superiority in No Man's Land which
         
         [<a id="p98" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/98/mode/1up">p98</a>]
          the Battalion had always previously
         enjoyed, and prevent the enemy advancing beyond his own wire; these orders were
         carried out with conspicuous success.</p>
      
      <p>The remainder of the tour passed uneventfully, and on <span title="1916-12-11">December 11th</span> we were relieved by the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment,
         and withdrew to billets in <a id="place357" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a> as
         Divisional Reserve. The men were billeted in huts, which were weatherproof, but
         very cold, as only one small stove was available for 30 men; gridded paths
         between huts were in good order, but it was essential to keep to the grids as
         the ground elsewhere was ankle deep in mud, which a snow storm during the night
         made worse than ever. Bathing, interior economy, route-marching, and company
         training, as far as bad weather permitted, occupied the next few days. The
         Divisional Concert Party, the "Whizz-Bangs," gave their
         opening performance in <a id="place358" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a> on the
         <span title="1916-12-12">12th</span>, and their entertainment provided every
         evening after this date was very highly appreciated. The condition of the
         trenches to which we returned on the <span title="1916-12-17">17th</span>, in
         spite of constant repair work, was found to be steadily deteriorating, and
         constant pumping was necessary in many places to render them tenable, and the
         mud was 12 to 18 inches deep in the front line. The supply of trench boots was
         fairly adequate, but the prevention of trench feet was promoted with anxious
         care all through the winter by taking every precaution. The orders of the <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers857"><abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> Battalion</a> were strictly obeyed; every man went daily to the
         stretcher bearers' dug out, where his feet were well rubbed with whale oil, dry
         socks were put on, and boots were changed; by strict adherence to these
         instructions while in trenches the incidence of trench feet in the Battalion was
         rendered almost negligible.</p>

      <p>On <span title="1916-12-21">December 21st</span> we were relieved and proceeded to
         <a id="place359" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a> as Brigade Reserve. The
         new billets were good, and cellars were available for all, an important asset in
         view of the fact that bombardments of the area were increasingly frequent.
         <a href="people-index.html#Fane, W V R Lt-Col" title="Fane, W V R Lt-Col" id="pers253">
            Lieut.-Col.
            Fane</a>, commanding the 3rd Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment, who had come
         out for a course of instruction, was attached to Battalion Headquarters, and was
         a welcome guest for a week from the <span title="1916-12-21">21st</span>. The
         usual strong parties for fatigues were supplied daily until the <span title="1916-12-24">24th, Christmas Eve</span>, when all available men were
         paraded in the street in <a id="place360" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a>
         for inspection by <a href="people-index.html#Simpson, Charles Rudyard, Lt-Gen" title="Simpson, Charles Rudyard, Lt-Gen" id="pers254">
            Lieut.-General
            Simpson</a>, Colonel of the Lincolnshire Regiment, who addressed the Battalion
         in a humourous manner, and expressed his great pleasure at being able to see a
         Territorial Battalion of the County Regiment on Active Service —fortunately the
         enemy artillery were quiet during the proceedings.</p>
      
      <p>It had been arranged that the Battalion should relieve the 1/4th Lincolnshire
         Regiment in the trenches on <span title="1916-12-25">Christmas Day</span>, and
         consequently, at the men's request, all Christmas festivities and celebrations
         were postponed until our relief, when we should be back in billets in <a id="place361" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a>. A re-arrangement of the trench
         sector had been carried out, and on returning to the trenches on the <span title="1916-12-25">25th</span>, only two Companies were distributed in the
         line, two Companies in dug-outs in support in <a id="place362" href="place-index.html?n=Hannescamps, France" title="Hannescamps, France">Hannescamps</a> and Crawlboys Lane, while Battalion Headquarters
         remained at <a id="place363" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a>. The trenches
         were in a terrible condition, knee deep in water and liquid mud in most places,
         and in spite of continuous pumping and drainage tended to get worse, as the
         weather continued wet. On the <span title="1916-12-28">28th</span>, a heavy
         bombardment of the sector on our left at 3 a.m.— 
         [<a id="p100" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/100/mode/1up">p100</a>]
          we heard later that the enemy attempted a raid, which was
         repulsed—caused the Battalion to stand to until 4 a.m. but our front was not
         attacked; otherwise the tour was quiet, and after another night's heavy rain we
         were relieved on the morning of the <span title="1916-12-29">29th</span> and
         returned to billets at <a id="place364" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a>, where
         the condition of the camp showed no improvement, a wilderness of mud, with leaky
         huts without doors, but fortunately the morale of the Battalion was high, there
         was no grumbling, and all were cheerfully determined to make the best of it
         under most adverse conditions.</p>
      
      <p>Next day, <span title="1916-12-30">December 30th</span>, was kept as Christmas
         Day, i.e., a whole holiday. In the morning the various gifts, cake, chocolate,
         fruit, cigarettes, etc., from the Christmas Comforts' Fund, raised as the year
         before by <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Adelina (d 1932)" title="Sandall, Adelina (d 1932)" id="pers255">
            Mrs.
            Sandall
            </a> in our district of Lincolnshire, were distributed; in order that
         cooking facilities might be ample, A and B companies dined at 1 p.m., and C and
         D at 4 p.m., a good dinner with plum pudding, etc., was provided, and the
         officers all did their best to make the festive occasion a success, and everyone
         enjoyed themselves. On <span title="1917-01-02">January 2nd</span>, as it had
         been decided in view of the bad weather and awful state of the trenches, that
         the Battalions should be relieved temporarily every four days, instead of every
         six, as usual, we relieved the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment. <a href="people-index.html#Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" title="Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" id="pers256">Major
            H. G.
            Wilson</a> proceeded to England to join the
         Senior Officers' Course for three months, and <a href="people-index.html#Tetley, Francis Eric, Lt-Col" title="Tetley, Francis Eric, Lt-Col" id="pers257">Major
            F. E.
            Tetley</a>, 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment,
         joined the Battalion for temporary duty as 2nd-in-Command.</p>
      
      <p>It was now realised that it was quite impossible to maintain a continuous trench
         line in repair, and certain lengths of the front line were abandoned, blocks
         constructed, and the disused trench filled with barbed wire, and wired over, and
         the garrisons 
         [<a id="p101" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/101/mode/1up">p101</a>]
          gradually reduced to isolated
         posts at the heads of the communication trenches. On <span title="1917-01-03">January 3rd</span>, owing to the absence of the <a href="people-index.html#Kemp, Geoffrey Chicheley, Brig-Gen" title="Kemp, Geoffrey Chicheley, Brig-Gen" id="pers858">Brigadier</a> on
         leave, the <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers859">
            <abbr title="Commanding Officer">C.O.</abbr>
            </a> left the Battalion to assume temporary command of the Brigade, while
         <a href="people-index.html#Tetley, Francis Eric, Lt-Col" title="Tetley, Francis Eric, Lt-Col" id="pers258">
            Major
            Tetley
            </a> took over the temporary command of the Battalion. Except for
         occasional enemy bombardment no special incident occurred, and we were relieved
         on the <span title="1917-01-06">6th</span> and returned to <a id="place365" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a> as Brigade Reserve, where a small
         draft of 85 men joined. The village was somewhat heavily shelled on the evening
         of the <span title="1917-01-09">9th</span>, but none of our billets were damaged,
         and the Battalion returned to the trenches on the <span title="1917-01-10">10th</span>. Rain fell nearly every day, and every available man was employed
         in pumping and clearing trenches, and repairing damage done by enemy shelling,
         which was troublesome at intervals.</p>
      
      <p>On the <span title="1917-01-14">14th</span> the Battalion were only too ready to
         be relieved, and proceed to billets in <a id="place366" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a>— the weather cleared for a day or two, permitting some
         platoon and physical training, but a heavy snowstorm on the <span title="1917-01-17">17th</span> caused everything to be suspended. On <span title="1917-01-18">January 18th</span>, when we returned to the trenches, a
         redistribution of the Battalion was adopted, two Companies plus one platoon
         holding the line, one Company (less one platoon) in support in the crypt under
         the church at <a id="place367" href="place-index.html?n=Hannescamps, France" title="Hannescamps, France">Hannescamps</a>, and one
         Company with Battalion Headquarters at <a id="place368" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a>. Enemy shelling during the tour was very
         troublesome and did much damage, although causing very few casualties; when the
         Battalion was relieved on the morning of the <span title="1917-01-22">22nd</span>, one platoon was unable to be relieved till after dark, as the
         trench was blocked and the parapet destroyed.</p>
      
      <p>The weather began to improve, and sharp frost succeeded the constant rain to
         everyone's delight; the next tour in the trenches was comparatively 
         [<a id="p102" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/102/mode/1up">p102</a>]
          free from hardship, as at least everyone
         could keep dry if not warm, and on <span title="1917-01-30">Jan. 30th</span> we
         again returned to <a id="place369" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a> as
         Divisional Reserve, when a careful reorganization of each Company into platoons
         and sections was carried out. Meanwhile a fresh distribution of front was made,
         the Brigade sector "side-slipping" to the North, and when we
         relieved the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment on <span title="1917-02-03">February
            3rd</span>, Battalion Headquarters were moved from <a id="place370" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a> to <a id="place371" href="place-index.html?n=Hannescamps, France" title="Hannescamps, France">Hannescamps</a>, two Companies held the line, and two Companies were in
         support in dug-outs and in the crypt at <a id="place372" href="place-index.html?n=Hannescamps, France" title="Hannescamps, France">Hannescamps</a>. The 2/6th London Regiment were attached to us for a
         few days for instruction, and gave great assistance in the work of repairing
         trenches. The C.O., <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers259">

            Major

            </a> remaining as 2nd-in-Command. On the <span title="1917-02-05">5th</span>
         <a href="people-index.html#Maxse, Ivor, Lt-Gen" title="Maxse, Ivor, Lt-Gen" id="pers261">Lieut.-General
            Sir
            I. Maxse</a>, the
         G.O.C. XVIII. Corps, to which the 46th Division now belonged, visited the
         trenches, and expressed satisfaction with what he found. We were relieved and
         proceeded to <a id="place373" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a> on the <span title="1917-02-07">7th</span>, and in the evening received an unexpected
         warning to be ready to move <span title="1917-02-08">next day</span>, definite
         orders being received at midnight. Owing to the crowded state of the front area
         where new second line Territorial Divisions were up for instruction, it was
         found that one Battalion of the 138th Brigade could be spared to go back for a
         short rest, and to our great delight we were selected. Accordingly on <span title="1917-02-08">February 8th</span> the Battalion marched by Platoons from
         <a id="place374" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a> to <a id="place375" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a>, and thence by Companies through
         <a id="place376" href="place-index.html?n=Pas-en-Artois, France" title="Pas-en-Artois, France">Pas</a> to <a id="place377" href="place-index.html?n=Grenas, Pommera, France" title="Grenas, Pommera, France">Grenas</a>—about eight miles—which were covered in three hours. At
         <a id="place378" href="place-index.html?n=Grenas, Pommera, France" title="Grenas, Pommera, France">Grenas</a> excellent billets were
         available with plenty of room, the training carried out during the next ten days
         was entirely in the hands of the <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers860"><abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> Battalion</a>, and the rest from 
         [<a id="p103" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/103/mode/1up">p103</a>]
          the trenches, all the more welcome from being unexpected, was much enjoyed.
         One Company was detailed to work under <a href="people-index.html#Lotbiniere, Henri Gustave Joly de, Brig-Gen" title="Lotbiniere, Henri Gustave Joly de, Brig-Gen" id="pers861"><abbr title="Commander Royal Engineers">C. R.E.</abbr> XVIII. Corps</a>, at <a id="place379" href="place-index.html?n=Pas-en-Artois, France" title="Pas-en-Artois, France">Pas</a>, and billeted there for three days, being then relieved by
         another, while the remainder of the Battalion carried out daily training,
         especially in trench attack. The only unfortunate incident of our stay at
         <a id="place380" href="place-index.html?n=Grenas, Pommera, France" title="Grenas, Pommera, France">Grenas</a> was a fire, which broke out
         in a billet occupied by D Company about 9 p.m. on <span title="1917-02-10">February 10th</span>, due to a spark from the Company cooker setting alight
         to the thatch. The fire was subdued by 11 p.m. but considerable damage was done
         to the property, and some rifles and equipment were destroyed. The <a href="people-index.html#Schiller, Louis Christian, Capt" title="Schiller, Louis Christian, Capt" id="pers862">Adjutant</a> greatly
         distinguished himself as an amateur fireman on this occasion, and the whole
         Battalion worked hard to extinguish the conflagration as soon as possible.</p>
      
      <p>After a pleasant stay of ten days orders were received to return to the trench
         area on the <span title="1917-02-18">18th</span>, and the Battalion marched to
         <a id="place381" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a> where billets were found
         for the night, and a draft of 75 men joined <span title="1917-02-18">next
            day</span>. In the evening the Battalion relieved the 1/4th Lincolnshire
         Regiment in the old trench sector, which however had been somewhat extended. A
         frontage of over 2,000 yards was now held by the Battalion by a series of
         isolated posts, the intervening trenches being blocked and wired in; these posts
         were manned by 2½ companies, while 1½ companies and Battalion Headquarters were
         in <a id="place382" href="place-index.html?n=Hannescamps, France" title="Hannescamps, France">Hannescamp</a>. The sector was a very
         quiet one as a rule, as in places the trenches were nearly 1,000 yards apart and
         rifle fire was practically absent, but on <span title="1917-02-21">February
            21st</span>, from 3 to 4 a.m., a very heavy bombardment with shells of all
         calibres on our right sector was carried out; although the material damage was
         considerable, only one casualty was caused, and the enemy made no attempt to 
         [<a id="p104" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/104/mode/1up">p104</a>]
          approach our line. On the <span title="1917-02-22">22nd</span>, a gas shell bombardment caused a few
         casualties. The weather during the last few days had been very misty, but fine
         and mild: the thaw, as was to be expected, had again converted the trenches into
         channels of liquid mud, rendering them absolutely impassable in places, but
         owing to the mist this was not of so much importance, as it was quite safe even
         during daylight to move about over the open in our own lines, as the enemy
         trenches were so far away. On <span title="1917-02-23">February 23rd</span> we
         were relieved at 8.30 p.m., Battalion Headquarters and two Companies proceeding
         to <a id="place383" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a>, while two Companies
         under the 2nd-in-Command occupied
         dug-outs at <a id="place384" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a>, this being
         the new distribution of the Brigade Reserve. This proved to be our last tour of
         monotonous trench warfare during the winter of 1916-17, as before we returned to
         the trenches on the <span title="1917-02-27">27th</span>, the great German
         retreat to the Hindenburg Line had begun, and more interesting and more exciting
         work than holding a trench line fell to our lot.</p>
