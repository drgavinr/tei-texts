      <h2>Egypt and the Vimy Ridge</h2>
      
      <p>The journey of the Battalion from the <abbr title="North">N.</abbr> to the <abbr title="South">S.</abbr> of France is difficult to describe, and still more so to appreciate
         correctly. The immediate future was very obscure; rumour said the Battalion was
         bound for Serbia! The journey was as thoroughly uncomfortable in every small
         detail as the disorganised railway service of France could make it. But as the
         murkiness and mud of the North gave place to the brilliant sunshine, dazzling
         white roofs, and olives of the South, the spirits of all defied uncertainty, and
         rose against reason. During the first day the men huddled together for warmth in
         their cattle-trucks, and peered through the mist at the shell-stricken villages
         they passed; on the second they lounged at the open doorways; on the third they
         sat on the roofs in their shirt sleeves, reduced to silence in their
         appreciation of the turbulent Rhone in the foreground on the right, and the snow
         clad Alps seen over a long vista of terraced vineyards on the left.</p>
      
      <p>We arrived at <a id="place211" href="place-index.html?n=Marseille, France" title="Marseille, France">Marseilles</a> at 8.15 p.m. on
         <span title="1916-01-07">January 7th</span>, and a hurried march through the
         deserted streets was followed by embarkation at the docks at 2 p.m. on the <span title="1916-01-08">8th</span>.</p>
      
      <p>The voyage was uneventful, the weather monotonously pleasant, and from the time
         that the rocky coast of Southern France was lost to view until the sunburnt
         looking coast of Malta appeared, the normal routine was an unvaried succession
         of meals, sleep, 
         [<a id="p59" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/59/mode/1up">p59</a>]
          and submarine alarms, which
         fortunately did not materialise. Probably on account of the last mentioned, when
         off Malta, our vessel turned and steamed hurriedly back for 12 hours, then as
         suddenly turned again, and finally arrived off <a id="place212" href="place-index.html?n=Alexandria, Egypt" title="Alexandria, Egypt">Alexandria</a> at 10 a.m. on <span title="1916-01-13">January
            13th</span>.</p>
      
      <p>The town appeared as a white spot on a desert shore from a distance, but on
         closer acquaintance the prospect was somewhat marred by dirt and a dust storm.
         However, the suburbs appeared very beautiful but the Battalion was hurriedly
         entrained on the quay at 2 a.m. on the <span title="1916-01-14">14th</span>, and
         there was little rest for anyone until <span title="1916-01-15">next day</span>
         the train stopped at <a id="place213" href="place-index.html?n=Mahsama, Egypt" title="Mahsama, Egypt">Mahsana</a>, where the
         engine apparently broke down; at any rate, we stopped for 18 hours, which
         afforded a full day's rest for quiet reflection and the opportunity of
         inspecting a native village. The destination of the Battalion, <a id="place214" href="place-index.html?n=Shallufa, Egypt" title="Shallufa, Egypt">El Shalufa</a>, a few mud huts on the Suez Canal,
         two miles <abbr title="South">S.</abbr> of the Bitter Lakes, was reached at 11 a.m. on <span title="1916-01-15">January 15th</span>. We detrained, crossed the Canal by ferry, and
         proceeded to bivouac; tents for officers and men arrived a few hours later, but
         no drinking water or rations until the <span title="1916-01-16">next day</span>.</p>
      
      <p>The Camp at <a id="place215" href="place-index.html?n=Shallufa, Egypt" title="Shallufa, Egypt">Shalufa</a>, occupied by the
         Staffordshire Brigade and the two Lincolnshire Battalions, was was situated on
         the East bank of the Suez Canal, only separated from it by a single line of low
         sand-dunes. To the east of the men's lines were a few shallow trenches, and then
         about 60 miles of gently undulating rock strewn desert, ending on the horizon in
         a range of mountains of which every detail stood out with surprising clearness.
         To the west of the Canal another range about five miles away seemed only about
         as many hundred yards, rising very steeply from the desert, and apparently
         absolutely sterile and arid. The days were very hot, the nights 
         [<a id="p60" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/60/mode/1up">p60</a>]
          equally cold, and any wind that blew raised
         clouds of sand, but nevertheless a fortnight passed very pleasantly. The
         defensive trenches were worked at on the <span title="1916-01-15">first
            day</span>, and subsequently open warfare training was carried out daily, varied
         by close order drill, and musketry. By day the desert to the <abbr title="East">E.</abbr> was patrolled for many miles by squadrons of Indian Lancers, but by
         night each of the Battalions furnished an outpost line round the camp in turn;
         we occupied the outpost line on the nights of <span title="1916-01-20">20th</span> and <span title="1916-01-26">26th January</span>.</p>
      
      <p>This peaceful existence, was rudely disturbed by the news that the Division was
         to return immediately to France, and <span title="1916-01-29">January 29th</span>
         was spent in hurriedly packing and handing over to units of the 42nd Division;
         at 6.15 p.m., the Battalion entrained, arriving at 7 a.m. on <span title="1916-01-30">January 30th</span> at <a id="place216">Sid
            Gabaeh</a>, close to <a id="place217" href="place-index.html?n=Alexandria, Egypt" title="Alexandria, Egypt">Alexandria</a>, and situated almost on the beach. Here we drew tents
         and pitched camp, the work for the next two days consisting of Battalion drill,
         and the relaxation of trips to <a id="place218" href="place-index.html?n=Alexandria, Egypt" title="Alexandria, Egypt">Alexandria</a>, either on small donkeys or by very efficient trams. On
         <span title="1916-02-02">February 2nd</span>, we received orders to stand-by
         ready to move at any time, but it was not until the <span title="1916-02-03">next
            day</span> that we proceeded to <a id="place219" href="place-index.html?n=Alexandria, Egypt" title="Alexandria, Egypt">Alexandria</a>, and re-embarked at 1.30 p.m. on S.S.
         Megantic to return to France. The vessel belonged to the White Star Line,
         and was most comfortably and admirably managed in all ways. We sailed at 12 noon
         on <span title="1916-02-04">February 4th</span>, and had an uneventful voyage,
         passing Malta on the <span title="1916-02-06">6th</span>, arriving at Marseilles
         on <span title="1916-02-09">February 9th</span>, disembarking and entraining
         within a few hours. The reverse change to that on the outward journey, from
         sunlight and Peace to gloom and squalor and War was experienced, and we
         detrained at 11.30 a.m. on <span title="1916-02-11">February 11th</span> at
         <a id="place220" href="place-index.html?n=Pont-Remy, France" title="Pont-Remy, France">Pont Remy</a> station in a cold
         drizzle, marching thence 
         [<a id="p61" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/61/mode/1up">p61</a>]
          to <a id="place221" href="place-index.html?n=Gorenflos, France" title="Gorenflos, France">Gorenflos</a>, where we arrived wet through and
         somewhat depressed, to find billets of the old familiar type.</p>
      
      <p>Battalion life was arranged for the next few weeks with the one object of
         re-acclimatising the men to the mist and cold of Flanders, and re-accustoming
         all ranks to the tactics and conditions of trench warfare, training in which had
         been entirely neglected during the past three months. The weather was uniformly
         bad, snow, thaw, and rain succeeding each other, but training was carried on as
         far as weather conditions allowed. The Battalion remained in the same billets
         till <span title="1916-02-20">February 20th</span>, when we marched to <a id="place222" href="place-index.html?n=Autheux, France" title="Autheux, France">Autheux</a> where training continued on the same
         lines. On <span title="1916-02-22">February 22nd</span>, the Machine Gun Section
         of the Battalion came to an end, the gunners being transferred to the Machine
         Gun Corps, while the machine guns were replaced in the Battalion by Lewis Guns,
         and for the next few weeks the training of men in Lewis Gun work was made the
         most important part of the programme. On <span title="1916-02-24">February
            24th</span> we again moved billets to <a id="place223" href="place-index.html?n=Bonneville, Somme, Picardie, France" title="Bonneville, Somme, Picardie, France">Bonneville</a>, each change bringing us nearer to the battle zone, and
         on the <span title="1916-02-29">29th</span> we marched via <a id="place224" href="place-index.html?n=Beauval, France" title="Beauval, France">Beauval</a> to <a id="place225" href="place-index.html?n=Gezaincourt, France" title="Gezaincourt, France">Gelincourt</a>. On <span title="1916-03-01">March 1st</span> the
         Brigade marched in heavy snow to <a id="place226" href="place-index.html?n=Doullens, France" title="Doullens, France">Doullens</a>, where we remained for a week, the usual training being
         varied by long route marches in the snow, and on <span title="1916-03-05">March
            5th</span> the <a href="people-index.html#Westmorland, Percy Thuillier, Lt-Col" title="Westmorland, Percy Thuillier, Lt-Col" id="pers822">
            <abbr title="Commanding Officer">C.O.</abbr>
            </a> and a number of officers were motored up to <a id="place227" href="place-index.html?n=Mont-Saint-Eloi, France" title="Mont-Saint-Eloi, France">Mount St. Eloi</a>, and from there proceeded on foot to inspect a
         line of trenches just <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> of the Crest of Vimy Ridge, <abbr title="South">S.</abbr> of <a id="place228" href="place-index.html?n=Souchez, France" title="Souchez, France">Souchez</a>, which the
         Battalion was destined shortly to take over from the French. The communication
         trenches were entered soon after passing the famous village of <a id="place229" href="place-index.html?n=Carency, France" title="Carency, France">Carency</a>, captured by the French in <span title="1915-05">May, 1915</span>, at a frightful cost of life, and the party
         advanced slowly knee-deep in mud with the spur of Notre 
         [<a id="p62" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/62/mode/1up">p62</a>]

         After two miles of trenches the party emerged into the open in the Talus des
         Zouaves, a valley deep and narrow enough to afford protection from shell fire,
         though within 500 yards of the front line. From the Talus a main communication
         trench, the Boyau Vincent, brought them to the support line, and Battalion
         Headquarters, where they were hospitably received by their French hosts, by whom
         they were shown round the trenches.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1916-03-06">March 6th</span>, the Brigade marched to <a id="place231" href="place-index.html?n=Petit-Houvin, Hautecloque, France" title="Petit-Houvin, Hautecloque, France">Houvin</a>, and after <span title="1916-03-07">a
            day</span> spent in Company training, the Battalion marched on the <span title="1916-03-08">8th</span> via <a id="place232" href="place-index.html?n=Aubigny-en-Artois, France" title="Aubigny-en-Artois, France">Aubigny</a> to <a id="place233" href="place-index.html?n=Villers-Chatel, France" title="Villers-Chatel, France">Villers Chatel</a>,
         where the <span title="1916-03-09">next day</span> was spent, the Officers and
         some <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officers">N.C.O.'s</abbr> going up to reconnoitre the trench sector to be taken over. On <span title="1916-03-10">March 10th</span>, the Battalion marched to <a id="place234" href="place-index.html?n=Villers-au-Bois, France" title="Villers-au-Bois, France">Villers-au-Bois</a>, the trench Brigade
         Headquarters, and thence by Platoons into the trenches, relieving the 90th
         Regiment of French Infantry.</p>
      
      <p>The sector now occupied was one in which the trenches were very sketchy,
         consisting mainly of isolated posts, which could only be reached at night, and
         over the open, as communication trenches to some did not exist and to others
         were so shallow and exposed as to be useless. All the trenches were shallow, and
         any effort to deepen them usually resulted in the shelling of the points worked
         at, as the chalky soil of the Vimy Ridge made newly thrown up soil stand up
         clearly as a white line, which provided an excellent object on which enemy
         artillery could range. Three Companies were distributed in the front line, of
         which one could be reached by day, and one Company in support round Battalion
         Headquarters. On the night of the <span title="1916-03-12">12th</span>, the
         Germans exploded a small mine close to the parapet of one of our trenches, and
         followed it by a bombing attack. 
         [<a id="p63" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/63/mode/1up">p63</a>]
         
         <a href="people-index.html#Warren, Fred, 240216" title="Warren, Fred, 240216" id="pers195">Sergeant
            F. Warren</a>
         showed great coolness and resource under heavy fire in organising the defence at
         the threatened point and repelling the bombing attack, and was subsequently
         awarded the Military Medal for his conduct on this occasion. On the evening of
         the <span title="1916-03-13">13th</span> an inter-Company relief was effected,
         the two isolated Companies being relieved by the other two. A certain amount of
         work was done on improvement and repair of trenches, as far as the weather
         allowed, and on the <span title="1916-03-15">15th</span> we were relieved by the
         1/4th Leicestershire Regiment, and became Brigade Reserve, with Battalion
         Headquarters and three Companies in dug-outs in the Talus de Zouaves, and one
         Company in dug- outs on the road by the Cabaret Rouge. Strong working parties
         were supplied daily for work on the communication trenches, and on the <span title="1916-03-21">21st</span> we returned to the front line. The weather
         during the next week was cold with frequent falls of snow, the usual
         inter-Company relief was effected on the night of the <span title="1916-03-24">24th</span>, and on the <span title="1916-03-27">27th</span> the Battalion
         was relieved by the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment, and proceeded back to the
         huts at <a id="place235" href="place-index.html?n=Camblain-l'Abbe, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Camblain-l'Abbe, Pas-de-Calais, France">Camblain l'Abbé</a> as Divisional
         Reserve.</p>
      
      <p>The condition of the Battalion at this time was unfortunately not very
         satisfactory; casualties and sickness had reduced our strength to less than half
         our establishment, especially in officers, the men appeared somewhat dispirited
         and depressed, and the execrable weather added to the difficulties; a certain
         amount of general slackness prevailed, and on <span title="1916-04-01">April
            1st</span>, when the Divisional Commander inspected the Battalion, while the <abbr title="Commanding Officer">C.O.</abbr>, <a href="people-index.html#Westmorland, Percy Thuillier, Lt-Col" title="Westmorland, Percy Thuillier, Lt-Col" id="pers196">

         [<a id="p64" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/64/mode/1up">p64</a>]
          by four officers and 62 other ranks of 1/4th Leicestershire
         Regiment, as only eight officers of the Battalion were available, and the rifle
         strength was much below the minimum necessary to hold the position safely.
         During the tour the improvement of the trenches was steadily pushed forward, and
         a new defence line of trenches was laid out, and partially constructed,
         interfered with at intervals by enemy trench mortar bombardments. On <span title="1916-04-08">April 8th</span>, the Battalion was relieved and returned
         to the Talus des Zouaves as Brigade Reserve.</p>

         the command and organization of Companies; a new Regimental Sergeant-Major,

            F. Credland</a>
         was appointed; and on <span title="1916-04-09">April 9th</span> a strong draft of
         127 other ranks arrived, which brought the Battalion strength to 14 officers and
         640 other ranks, weak enough still in all conscience but yet strong enough to
         enable us to hold our sector in the line without assistance from other
         Battalions in the Brigade. No effort was spared in the attempt to restore to the
         Battalion the discipline, morale, and efficiency of the old Battalion, which had
         been cut to pieces at the Hohenzollern Redoubt, and in due time this was
         effected with complete success.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1916-04-13">April 13th</span> the Talus des Zouaves was very
         heavily shelled by enemy Howitzers, the only type of artillery that could reach
         it, and a considerable amount of material damage was done to <abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr>
         
         [<a id="p65" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/65/mode/1up">p65</a>]
          stores, but no casualties were caused, as the
         dug-outs were situated on the reverse slope of the valley, the sides of which
         were so steep as to afford them almost complete protection. On the <span title="1916-04-14">14th</span>, we returned to the trenches for our last tour
         in the front line on the Vimy Ridge, and were subjected as usual to considerable
         trench mortar bombardment, which caused much material damage and entailed
         endless work, but inflicted very few casualties, although on the <span title="1916-04-18">18th</span>

         by 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment, and slowly wended our way back to our quarters
         in Divisional Reserve in the huts at <a id="place236" href="place-index.html?n=Camblain-l'Abbe, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Camblain-l'Abbe, Pas-de-Calais, France">Camblain

      <p>During the time the Brigade held it, the sector was immensely improved and
         strengthened; the trenches were deepened and drained, a certain amount of
         shelter provided, and an entirely new defensive position prepared behind the
         front line. More important still all the isolated posts had been connected with
         the defence line by communication trenches, which rendered communication
         possible by day with all portions of the line to the great advantage of
         everyone. The <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers823">

         others, whose duties entailed nightly visits across the open to isolated posts,
         particularly appreciated this last improvement, as it was not always possible in
         the darkness to be sure, whether the post that one saw was our own or the
         enemy's, and the strain of listening to hear what language was spoken by the
         garrison before approaching too near was considerable.</p>
