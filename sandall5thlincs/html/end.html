      <h2>The End</h2>
      
      <p>The Battalion was stationed at <a id="place718" href="place-index.html?n=Bousies, France" title="Bousies, France">Bousies</a>
         from <span title="1918-11-14">November 14th, 1918</span>, to <span title="1919-02-24">February 24th, 1919</span>, and was occupied during that
         period chiefly in salvage work, filling in of trenches, and a certain amount of
         Company training, but the details of a somewhat weary time of waiting are of no
         interest. On <span title="1918-11-26">November 26th</span>, the educational
         classes, which occupied one hour a day, were started. Ceremonial guard-mounting
         was established for Battalion and Brigade guards, each Battalion finding the
         Brigade duties in turn. On <span title="1918-11-30">November 30th</span> the
         King's and Regimental Colours, brought from England by Lieuts. <a href="people-index.html#Stanley, Lt" title="Stanley, Lt" id="pers569">
            Stanley
            </a> and <a href="people-index.html#Mansfield, Lt" title="Mansfield, Lt" id="pers570">
            Mansfield</a>, were received with due ceremony. Recreational training was the rule
         in the afternoons, and as many forms of entertainment as possible were arranged
         for the evenings. The Divisional Concert Party, the Whizz-Bangs, gave their
         entertainment each night for a week at intervals, various lectures were given,
         boxing competitions held, and every endeavour was made to provide amusement and
         recreation for the men.</p>
      
      <p>Christmas was spent in the usual fashion, excellent Company dinners were
         provided, and the Christmas Comforts Fund again contributed largely to the
         enjoyment of all ranks.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1919-01-01">January 1st, 1919</span>, the preparations for
         demobilization began, and to the great relief of all ranks the regimental
         censorship of letters was abolished. Salvage work and the filling in of 
         [<a id="p195" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/195/mode/1up">p195</a>]
          trenches continued, with Platoon and
         Company-training. A Platoon competition in drill and general training was held
         during the <span title="1919-01">month</span>, and after very keen competition
         No. 2 Platoon, <a href="people-index.html#Wilson, Alfred, 201577" title="Wilson, Alfred, 201577" id="pers571">
            Sergt.
            Wilson</a>, was declared the winner, No. 5 Platoon, <a href="people-index.html#Arvell, A, Sgt" title="Arvell, A, Sgt" id="pers572">Sergt.
            A. Arvell</a>,
         being second. A mock election provided amusement and excitement during the 3rd
         week in January, the candidates being "Sir John Boosey,"
         "Mademoiselle Burton," "Mr. R. U. Thursty,"
         and "Mr. Bully Beef."</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1919-02-05">February 5th</span> demobilization began, 41 Other
         Ranks being demobilized on the first day, and parties varying in number from 11
         to 68 daily on each succeeding day during the <span title="1919-02">month</span>.
         On the <span title="1919-02-24">24th</span> the Battalion, much depleted in
         numbers, moved from <a id="place719" href="place-index.html?n=Bousies, France" title="Bousies, France">Bousies</a> to
         <a id="place720" href="place-index.html?n=Solesmes, France" title="Solesmes, France">Solesnes</a>, where salvage work and
         demobilization continued. On <span title="1919-03-10">March 10th</span> the
         Battalion moved to <a id="place721" href="place-index.html?n=Saint-Hilaire-lez-Cambrai, France" title="Saint-Hilaire-lez-Cambrai, France">St. Hilaire</a>, and the
         demobilization of officers began. On <span title="1919-04-04">April 4th</span>, 3
         officers and 80 men left to join the 190th <abbr title="Prisoner of War Escort Company">P. of W. Escort Co.</abbr>, and 3 officers and 80 men the 263rd, and <span title="1919-04-05">next
            day</span> a further 3 officers and 80 men left to form the 93rd <abbr title="Prisoner of War Escort Company">P. of W. Escort Co.</abbr> at Calais, and the Battalion, thus being reduced almost to cadre
         strength, moved by lorry on <span title="1919-04-07">April 7th</span> to
         <a id="place722" href="place-index.html?n=Inchy, Nord, France" title="Inchy, Nord, France">Inchy</a>. On <span title="1919-04-12">April 12th</span> the remainder of the retainable personnel left to join
         the 216th <abbr title="Prisoner of War">P. of W.</abbr> Escort Company at <a id="place723" href="place-index.html?n=Caudry, France" title="Caudry, France">Caudry</a>, and
         the strength of the cadre Battalion was now 8 officers and 50 other ranks,
         including 2 attached.</p>
      
      <p>The cadre devoted itself chiefly to football, and the cadre team had a brilliant
         career. <a href="people-index.html#Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" title="Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" id="pers573">Lieut.-Colonel
            H. G.
            Wilson</a> from <span title="1919-04-29">April
            29th</span> onwards commanded the Divisional packet, as well as the
         Battalion cadre, who now waited with what patience they possessed, to proceed to
         England. On <span title="1919-05-20">May 20th</span> the cadre strength was
         reduced and from that date consisted of 5 officers and 38 other ranks. Week
         after week 
         [<a id="p196" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/196/mode/1up">p196</a>]
          passed, but on <span title="1919-06-24">June 24th</span>

         England with the Colours, arriving at <a id="place724" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a> on <span title="1919-06-29">Sunday, June 29th</span>, where
         they were received with great enthusiasm and the Colours were deposited in
         <a id="place725" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a> Parish Church, with due
         ceremony. The baggage guard, <a href="people-index.html#Plumtree, William Henry, Capt" title="Plumtree, William Henry, Capt" id="pers577">Captain

            P. Uppleby</a>,
         and 13 Other Ranks, with the equipment, moved to <a id="place726" href="place-index.html?n=Caudry, France" title="Caudry, France">Caudry</a> to await orders, which were not received till <span title="1919-07-19">July 19th</span>. On the <span title="1919-07-20">20th</span> the baggage guard left <a id="place727" href="place-index.html?n=Caudry, France" title="Caudry, France">Caudry</a> for <a id="place728" href="place-index.html?n=Dunkerque, France" title="Dunkerque, France">Dunkirk</a>, where
         the equipment was loaded up at the docks, and on <span title="1919-07-25">July
            25th</span> they proceeded to <a id="place729" href="place-index.html?n=Boulogne-sur-Mer, France" title="Boulogne-sur-Mer, France">Boulogne</a> and embarked for England.</p>
      
      <p>The history of the Battalion, which left England on <span title="1915-02-27">February 27th, 1915</span>, thus ends. The reconstitution of the
         Territorial Force in <span title="1920">1920</span> once more brought the 5th
         Battalion of the Lincolnshire Regiment into being, with all the traditions of
         the old Battalion, and there is no doubt that it will worthily maintain those
         traditions, and that reputation, of which every member of the old Battalion is
         justly proud.</p>
