      <h2>The Battle of Bellenglise and the Breaking of the Hindenburg Line</h2>
      
      <p><span title="1918-09-20">September 20th</span> was spent by the Battalion in
         building shelters for themselves at <a id="place644" href="place-index.html?n=Tertry, France" title="Tertry, France">Tertry</a>; fortunately the day was fine. On the <span title="1918-09-21">21st</span> after the morning had been devoted to
         practising the attack the Battalion at dark moved up to the line and relieved
         the 46th and 48th Battalions Australian Infantry in the right sub-sector, the
         relief being completed at 11 p.m., A and B Companies being in the line, D in
         support, and C in reserve. The <span title="1918-09-22">22nd</span> passed
         quietly, the area being shelled along the whole front with gas and <abbr title="High Explosive">H.E.</abbr>, but no casualties were sustained, although on the <span title="1918-09-23">23rd</span> 2 Other Ranks were killed and 7 wounded.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1918-09-24">September 24th</span> the 1st Division attacked on our
         right, and in order to assist this attack, a minor operation, the capture of
         <a id="place645" href="place-index.html?n=Pontruet, France" title="Pontruet, France">Pontruet</a> village and Forgans
         trench, was ordered to be carried out by the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment, the
         Battalion being detailed to mop up the trench system behind their advance. The
         attack was in a <abbr title="South-West">S.W.</abbr> direction under a creeping barrage and the operation was quite
         successful, although all the objectives were not taken. Two enemy posts were
         captured by our right company on the left flank of the 1/5th Leicestershire
         Regiment, and the line captured was consolidated; 150 prisoners were taken.
         During the <span title="1918-09-25">25th</span> our forward positions were
         somewhat heavily shelled, and an inter-company relief was effected in the
         evening. The trench line was held 
         [<a id="p175" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/175/mode/1up">p175</a>]
          until the
         evening of the <span title="1918-09-27">27th</span>, when the Battalion was
         relieved by the 1/6th South Staffordshire Regiment, and moved back to reserve
         trenches near <a id="place646" href="place-index.html?n=Le Verguier, France" title="Le Verguier, France">Le Vergier</a>, where we
         rested during the <span title="1918-09-28">28th</span>.</p>
      
      <p>No attempt will be made to describe the operations of the 46th Division as a
         whole, but a general idea of the scheme is necessary in order to understand the
         part played by the Battalion. The 46th Division was ordered to cross the St.
         Quintin canal, capture the Hindenburg line, and advance to positions beyond and
         consolidate them for defence, after which the 32nd Division would pass through
         the line, and continue the attack. The 30th American Division on the left were
         to attack simultaneously about 1,000 yards to north, and after crossing the
         Canal turn south, and gain touch with the 46th Division, and advance with them.
         The 137th Brigade on a three Battalion front led the Divisional attack, followed
         by the 138th and 139th Brigades, each on a one Battalion front, the 138th
         Brigade on the left, and the 139th Brigade on the right. The 1/4th
         Leicestershire Regiment was the leading Battalion of the 138th Brigade, followed
         by the 1/5th Lincolnshire, and 1/5th Leicestershire Regiments. As soon as the
         137th Brigade had crossed the Canal, and captured their objective, the 138th
         Brigade Battalions were to continue the advance by the leap-frog method, the
         1/4th Leicestershire having gained their objective would consolidate it for
         defence, the 1/5th Lincolnshire passing through this line would capture their
         objective, the village of <a id="place647" href="place-index.html?n=Magny-la-Fosse, France" title="Magny-la-Fosse, France">Magny La
            Fosse</a> and the high ground beyond, and finally the 1/5th
         Leicestershire Regiment would pass through our line, capture, and consolidate
         the final objective of the Brigade, joining hands with the 30th American
         Division on our left and the 139th Brigade on our right.</p>
      
      [<a id="p176" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/176/mode/1up">p176</a>]
      
      
      <p>At 3 a.m. on <span title="1918-09-29">September 29th</span> the Battalion left
         <a id="place648" href="place-index.html?n=Le Verguier, France" title="Le Verguier, France">Le Vergier</a> to take up assembly
         positions on Ascension Ridge. Zero hour was 5.30 a.m., when the 137th Brigade
         advanced. At 8.45 a.m. the Battalion moved forward to jumping off positions in
         the Hindenburg system west of the Canal. There was a dense fog, nothing whatever
         could be seen, and the advance had to be made on a compass bearing, but was
         successfully accomplished, the exact positions were attained, and the Battalion
         formed up with three Companies, B, A and D, from right to left in the front
         line, with C Company in support. The attack of the 137th Brigade had been a
         complete success, and at 10.30 a.m. the Battalion moved forward in artillery
         formation to the bridge across the Canal, resuming this formation and then
         extending into open formation as we approached the line which by 12 noon had
         been occupied by the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment at the west end of <a id="place649" href="place-index.html?n=Magny-la-Fosse, France" title="Magny-la-Fosse, France">Magny La Fosse</a>, in touch with the Americans on
         our left and the 139th Brigade on our right. At 12.30 p.m. the Battalion
         advanced from this line under a creeping barrage which advanced 100 yards in 4
         minutes, to <a id="place650" href="place-index.html?n=Magny-la-Fosse, France" title="Magny-la-Fosse, France">Magny La Fosse</a> village,
         flanking troops simultaneously advancing on our right and left. At this point,
         where the barrage was picked up, four tanks who were co-operating in the attack,
         moved forward with the Battalion. The right Company followed its tank, which
         moved forward along a trench system, successfully cleared the trench and ground
         and reached its objective without very much opposition. The centre Company sent
         two platoons to encircle the village on the south side, while two platoons moved
         through the village itself. The left Company moved forward and reached its
         objective without much opposition.</p>
      
      <p>When nearing the village, <a href="people-index.html#Spooner, Walter, 18206" title="Spooner, Walter, 18206" id="pers525">Corporal
            W. Spooner</a>;
         
         [<a id="p177" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/177/mode/1up">p177</a>]
          seeing that an enemy machine gun firing
         from the edge of a wood might hold up the advance, rushed forward with two
         sections, put the gun out of action, and captured four machine guns and 50
         prisoners in the wood. <a href="people-index.html#Sproston, Herbert Arnold, 241310" title="Sproston, Herbert Arnold, 241310" id="pers526">Private
            H. Sproston</a>,
         when the <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr> in charge of his Lewis gun section was wounded, took over the command
         of the section, knocked out an enemy machine gun that was giving trouble and led
         his section into the village with great determination, capturing two machine
         guns and 40 prisoners. <a href="people-index.html#Cooper, Albert Edward, 242310" title="Cooper, Albert Edward, 242310" id="pers527">Private
            A. Cooper</a>, in
         command of a section, located a machine gun, which was causing casualties, led
         his section to a flank, charged the position and captured the gun with its team.
         The large number of prisoners taken caused some delay in the advance, so the
         support Company was pushed forward, in order to keep up with the barrage,
         cleared the east end of the village and occupied the objective, which was
         reached at 1.20 p.m. At 1.50 p.m. the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment passed
         through our line towards their objective, about 1,000 yards east, which they
         successfully occupied, and the Divisional objective was thus obtained.</p>
      
      <p>The freedom with which the enemy surrendered was very noticeable, and the
         Battalion alone captured 400 prisoners, including several officers, and an
         artillery group commander, 7 field guns, and 20 machine guns. Our casualties
         during the advance were 1 Officer wounded, 5 Other
         Ranks killed, and 35 wounded, but some 20 further casualties were sustained
         later in the day from the enemy bombardment of the newly captured position.
         During the day <a href="people-index.html#Barker, Frederick Henton, 241199" title="Barker, Frederick Henton, 241199" id="pers528">Private
            F. H.
            Barker</a> did excellent work as a linesman,
         as he had done during the preceding operation on <span title="1918-09-24">September 24th</span>, going out under heavy fire to maintain
         communications, and gained the Military Medal; <a href="people-index.html#Harris, Joseph, 200017" title="Harris, Joseph, 200017" id="pers529">Lance-Corporal

         out his duties for many hours as a stretcher bearer, showing great gallantry and

         who, although wounded, continued to lead his section with great determination
         until the final objective was obtained.</p>
      
      <p>The consolidation of our position having been completed, on the <span title="1918-09-30">30th</span> C Company were again withdrawn into support
         and the remaining Companies were distributed over the Battalion frontage, each
         Company having one platoon in support. During the day the enemy kept up a steady
         artillery bombardment, and we suffered a few casualties. At 7 p.m. the Brigade
         front was reorganised, the 1/4th and 1/5th Leicestershire Regiments holding the
         line, while the Battalion was withdrawn into Brigade Reserve in shelters and
         cellars at the west end of <a id="place651" href="place-index.html?n=Magny-la-Fosse, France" title="Magny-la-Fosse, France">Magny La
            Fosse</a>. A warning order was received that the Battalion might be
         required to co-operate with the 32nd Division early next morning in an attack on
         <a id="place652" href="place-index.html?n=Joncourt, France" title="Joncourt, France">Joncourt</a> and <a id="place653" href="place-index.html?n=Estrees, France" title="Estrees, France">Estrees</a>, and a reconnaissance of the ground
         was therefore carried out, but we were not called upon, and <span title="1918-10-01">October 1st</span> passed quietly.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1918-10-02">October 2nd</span>, the Battalion paraded in the
         afternoon, and was addressed in congratulatory terms by the Brigadier on the
         operations of <span title="1918-09-29">September 29th</span>. The Transport and
         Quartermaster's Stores were brought forward and joined the Battalion at

          day, <span title="1918-10-03">October 3rd</span>, by the 46th Division, when the 138th
         Brigade would act as Divisional Reserve. On the morning of <span title="1918-10-03">October 3rd</span> orders were recceived to occupy a
         position in the railway cutting, which was reached at 10.30 a.m. At noon the
         Battalion was ordered to replace the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment in support of
         the 139th Brigade in the trenches of the <a id="place655" href="place-index.html?n=Beaurevoir, France" title="Beaurevoir, France">Beaurevoir</a>-<a id="place656" href="place-index.html?n=Fonsommes, France" title="Fonsommes, France">Fonsomme</a>
         line; and this move was completed by 2 p.m. At 3 o'clock two Companies were
         ordered to follow in close support of the 1st Monmouthshire Regiment, who were
         passing through them to repel a counter attack from the direction of <a id="place657" href="place-index.html?n=Fresnoy-le-Grand, France" title="Fresnoy-le-Grand, France">Fresnoy Le Grand</a>, and A and B Companies spread
         out along the <a id="place658" href="place-index.html?n=Beaurevoir, France" title="Beaurevoir, France">Beaurevoir</a>-<a id="place659" href="place-index.html?n=Fonsommes, France" title="Fonsommes, France">Fonsomme</a> line between the limits given. The
         attack of the morning had been successful, and all objectives gained, but about
         this time our positions on the eastern edge of <a id="place660" href="place-index.html?n=Montbrehain, France" title="Montbrehain, France">Montbrehans</a> were evacuated, the 1st Monmouthshire Regiment
         withdrawn, and our two Companies moved back. At 11 p.m. the 138th Brigade was
         ordered to relieve the 139th Brigade, and the 1st Monmouthshire and 1/4th
         Leicestershire Regiments took over the front line, while the Battalion moved in
         close support, with one Company in the sunken road, two Companies along the
         eastern edge of <a id="place661" href="place-index.html?n=Ramicourt, France" title="Ramicourt, France">Ramiecourt</a>, and one
         Company in the sunken road on the right. The shelling during the day was heavy,
         and two other ranks were killed, and 14 wounded.</p>

         the wounded.</p>
      
      <p>An enemy counter attack was expected on the <span title="1918-10-04">4th</span>,
         and all preparations were made to meet it, but it did not develop, and in the
         evening the Brigade was relieved by the 21st and 24th Battalions Australian
         Infantry, and the Battalion was withdrawn to a line of trenches and dug-outs
         between <a id="place662" href="place-index.html?n=Etricourt, Nauroy, France" title="Etricourt, Nauroy, France">Etricourt</a> and <a id="place663" href="place-index.html?n=Nauroy, France" title="Nauroy, France">Nauroy</a>, the move being completed at 1 a.m. on
         <span title="1918-10-05">October 5th</span>. At 7.30 p.m. the Battalion moved
         to other trenches in which there was very little shelter of any kind, but the
         weather was fine, there was no enemy artillery activity, and the next two days
         were spent quietly in cleaning and refitting. Many congratulatory messages were
         received with reference to the recent operations, including one from <a href="people-index.html#Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" title="Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" id="pers536">Major-General
