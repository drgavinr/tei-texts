      <h2>Trenches During The Spring and Summer of 1918</h2>
      
      <p>After a day spent at <a id="place550" href="place-index.html?n=Beuvry, France" title="Beuvry, France">Beuvry</a> in bathing
         and cleaning up generally, we were relieved by the 6th York and Lancaster
         Regiment on <span title="1918-01-19">January 19th</span> and marched to
         <a id="place551" href="place-index.html?n=L'Ecleme, Busnes, France" title="L'Ecleme, Busnes, France">L'Ecleme</a> near <a id="place552" href="place-index.html?n=Lillers, France" title="Lillers, France">Lillers</a>, where we spent the first two days in
         refitting and interior economy, together with the improvement of billets, and on
         the <span title="1918-01-22">22nd</span> began the usual training programme,
         musketry practices being carried out on a range at <a id="place553" href="place-index.html?n=Allouagne, France" title="Allouagne, France">Allouagne</a> about three miles away. On the <span title="1918-01-26">26th</span> the Battalion formed the Guard of Honour for a
         special medal riband presentation by the <a href="people-index.html#Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" title="Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" id="pers926"><abbr title="General Officer Commanding">G.O.C.</abbr> 46th Division</a>, who afterwards inspected the Battalion and
         expressed himself in very complimentary terms.</p>
      
      <p>The reorganization of the British Army, with the reduction of a Brigade from four
         to three Battalions, necessitated the disbandment of one Battalion in our
         Brigade, and the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment had been chosen as the one to be
         broken up. On <span title="1918-01-30">January 30th</span> a voluntary parade was
         held, which was attended by practically the whole Battalion, to march to
         <a id="place554" href="place-index.html?n=Busnes, France" title="Busnes, France">Busnes</a> to bid farewell to our
         sister Battalion; we gave three cheers and marched past before leaving. Twelve
         officers and 250 other ranks were posted from the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment to
         us, but temporarily remained at <a id="place555" href="place-index.html?n=Busnes, France" title="Busnes, France">Busnes</a>.
         On <span title="1918-02-01">February 1st</span> the Battalion was inspected in
         full marching order by the Brigadier, and in the afternoon 
         [<a id="p157" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/157/mode/1up">p157</a>]
          moved into fresh billets at <a id="place556" href="place-index.html?n=Mont-Bernanchon, France" title="Mont-Bernanchon, France">Mt.
            Bernenchon</a>, where we were joined by the draft from 1/4th
         Lincolnshire Regiment. Training continued and working parties were supplied for
         constructing defensive lines of wire until <span title="1918-02-16">February
            16th</span>, when we returned to our old billets at <a id="place557" href="place-index.html?n=L'Ecleme, Busnes, France" title="L'Ecleme, Busnes, France">L'Ecleme</a>, moving <span title="1918-02-17">next day</span> as
         part of a Brigade column in accordance with a Divisional scheme to <a id="place558" href="place-index.html?n=Palfart, France" title="Palfart, France">Febrin Palfart</a>. On the <span title="1918-02-09">9th</span> the Battalion moved as part of the main guard of the 138th
         Brigade, acting as the advanced guard of the Division in the Divisional scheme,
         via <a id="place559" href="place-index.html?n=Erny-Saint-Julien, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Erny-Saint-Julien, Pas-de-Calais, France">Erny St. Julien</a> and took up an
         outpost line on the Lys from <a id="place560" href="place-index.html?n=Delettes, France" title="Delettes, France">Delette</a> to
         <a id="place561">Le Wammel</a>, and then at 5 p.m.
         occupied billets in <a id="place562" href="place-index.html?n=Delettes, France" title="Delettes, France">Delette</a>, which we
         retained until the <span title="1918-02-28">end of the month</span>, <a href="people-index.html#Madge, Reginald Ellige, Capt" title="Madge, Reginald Ellige, Capt" id="pers479">
            Captain
            Madge
            </a> rejoining us on the <span title="1918-02-15">15th</span>. Nothing of
         interest occurred, the weather remained fine but cold, and steady progress was
         made with the training programme until <span title="1918-03-01">March 1st</span>,
         when we left <a id="place563" href="place-index.html?n=Delettes, France" title="Delettes, France">Delette</a> and marched,
         taking part in a Brigade operation, to <a id="place564" href="place-index.html?n=Estree-Blanche, France" title="Estree-Blanche, France">Estrée
            Blanche</a>, where we billeted for the night. On the <span title="1918-03-02">2nd</span> we marched to <a id="place565" href="place-index.html?n=Ham-en-Artois, France" title="Ham-en-Artois, France">Ham-en-Artois</a>, and <span title="1918-03-03">next day</span> to
         <a id="place566" href="place-index.html?n=Noeux-les-Mines, France" title="Noeux-les-Mines, France">Noeux-les-Mines</a>, and were once more
         in the front line area.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1918-03-03">March 3rd</span> we relieved the 6th Yorks and
         Lancaster Regiment in the trenches of the <a id="place567" href="place-index.html?n=Cambrin, France" title="Cambrin, France">Cambrin</a> North sector, the Battalion strength at this time being 24
         Officers and 582 Other Ranks. The tour passed without any noteworthy incident,
         but a number of casualties were sustained; we were relieved by the 1/4th
         Leicestershire Regiment on the <span title="1918-03-12">12th</span>, two
         Companies and Battalion Headquarters being in support at <a id="place568" href="place-index.html?n=Annequin, France" title="Annequin, France">Annequin</a> and two Companies in <a id="place569" href="place-index.html?n=Sailly, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Sailly, Pas-de-Calais, France">Sailly</a>-<a id="place733" href="place-index.html?n=Labourse, France" title="Labourse, France">la-Bourse</a>. On <span title="1918-03-14">March 14th</span> the Battalion moved back to <a id="place570" href="place-index.html?n=Beuvry, France" title="Beuvry, France">Beuvry</a> in reserve, and on the <span title="1918-03-16">16th</span> relieved the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment in the trenches in the
         Hohenzollern sector for a short 
         [<a id="p158" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/158/mode/1up">p158</a>]
          tour of four
         days, being relieved on the <span title="1918-03-20">20th</span> by the 1/4th
         Leicestershire Regiment.</p>
      
      <p>While in support, two Companies were in dug-outs in the reserve line, and two
         Companies with Battalion Headquarters at <a id="place571" href="place-index.html?n=Sailly, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Sailly, Pas-de-Calais, France">Sailly</a>-<a id="place734" href="place-index.html?n=Labourse, France" title="Labourse, France">la-Bourse</a>. On the <span title="1918-03-21">21st</span>
         the Battalion was ordered to stand to during the night owing to an expected
         attack, but this did not materialise on this portion of the front, although the
         next few days were spent under a considerable degree of strain, and active
         preparations to meet an attack were made. On <span title="1918-03-24">March
            24th</span> we were withdrawn into Divisional Reserve at <a id="place572" href="place-index.html?n=Beuvry, France" title="Beuvry, France">Beuvry</a>, marching to <a id="place573">Maroc</a> on the <span title="1918-03-27">27th</span>, where we billeted for the night, and <span title="1918-03-28">next
            day</span> relieved the 44th Canadian Infantry in the Hill 70 right sector.
         A very quiet tour passed, and we were relieved on <span title="1918-04-01">April
            1st</span>, moving to the Village line in support. After one day's rest we
         returned to the trenches relieving the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment in the Hill
         70 left sector, which we held to the <span title="1918-04-12">12th</span>; no
         special incident occurred and our only casualties were due to gas with which the
         enemy favoured us at intervals. On <span title="1918-04-12">April 12th</span> we
         were relieved by the 1st Canadian <abbr title="Mounted Rifles">M.R.</abbr> and proceeded into Army Reserve at <a id="place574">Bracquemont</a>.</p>
      
      <p>Training in open warfare took place daily, the weather being dull and cold. On
         the <span title="1918-04-18">18th</span>, when the enemy attacked at <a id="place575" href="place-index.html?n=Givenchy-les-la-Bassee, France" title="Givenchy-les-la-Bassee, France">Givenchy</a>, the Battalion was placed on one
         hour's notice to move, but were not called upon. About <span title="1918-04-21">April 21st</span> a virulent epidemic of influenza attacked the Battalion,
         and the whole Division, and for the next few days the number of sick removed to
         hospital was very large, from 20 to 40 daily, which reduced our fighting
         strength to such low numbers, that the efficiency of the Battalion was very
         seriously impaired. The whole Division suffered in the same way, and its 
         [<a id="p159" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/159/mode/1up">p159</a>]
          numbers for a long period were terribly below
         establishment.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1918-04-24">April 24th</span> the Battalion marched to <a id="place576" href="place-index.html?n=Bruay-la-Buissiere, France" title="Bruay-la-Buissiere, France">Bruay</a>, and the <span title="1918-04-25">next
            day</span> to <a id="place577" href="place-index.html?n=Verquin, France" title="Verquin, France">Verquin</a>, the Brigade
         being in Divisional Reserve. On the evening of <span title="1918-04-28">April
            28th</span> we returned to the front line, relieving the 1/6th Sherwood
         Foresters in a line from Les Facons to
         the swing bridge <abbr title="South-West">S.W.</abbr> of <a id="place579" href="place-index.html?n=Le Gassan, Locon, France" title="Le Gassan, Locon, France">Le Casan</a>, C and D
         Companies being in the front line, with A in support and B in reserve. The
         relief was completed under heavy shelling and we were lucky to sustain only
         three casualties. The general conditions in this Sector approached open warfare,
         as although the trenches were fairly continuous they were narrow and shallow,
         and no movement was possible by day. Early next morning a German of the 12th
         Reserve Division wandered into our lines, having lost his way. The enemy were
         inactive, and we sustained no casualties, and were relieved on <span title="1918-05-02">May 2nd</span> by the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment, going
         into support with two Companies at <a id="place580" href="place-index.html?n=Hamel, Beuvry, France" title="Hamel, Beuvry, France">Le
            Hamel</a>, one at La Motte Farm and one in the Newcastle line, the two
         forward Companies coming under the command of the <a href="people-index.html#Jones, Charles Herbert, Lt-Col (Leicestershire Regiment)" title="Jones, Charles Herbert, Lt-Col (Leicestershire Regiment)" id="pers927"><abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> 1/5th Leicestershires</a>. The usual working parties were
         supplied until <span title="1918-05-06">May 6th</span>, when we were relieved by
         the 1/6th North Staffordshire Regiment, and moved to billets in <a id="place581" href="place-index.html?n=Verquin, France" title="Verquin, France">Verquin</a>, the Brigade coming into Divisional
         Reserve.</p>
      
      <p>After a day devoted to interior economy, Company training was begun while the
         officers reconnoitred the <a id="place582" href="place-index.html?n=La Bassee, France" title="La Bassee, France">La Bassée</a>
         Canal and the Bridge-head defences. On the <span title="1918-05-09">9th</span>,
         in view of an expected hostile attack, We occupied defensive positions about the
         bridge-head at 10 p.m. But the night passed quietly and the Battalion returned
         to billets at <a id="place583" href="place-index.html?n=Verquin, France" title="Verquin, France">Verquin</a> at 7.30 a.m. on
         the <span title="1918-05-10">10th</span>, and all ranks endeavoured to get as
         much rest as possible, as we relieved the 1/5th 
         [<a id="p160" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/160/mode/1up">p160</a>]
          Sherwood Foresters in the <a id="place584" href="place-index.html?n=Gorre, Beuvry, France" title="Gorre, Beuvry, France">Gorre</a>
         right sub-sector in the evening, A and B Companies in the line, D in support,
         and C in reserve, with Battalion Headquarters at <a id="place585" href="place-index.html?n=Gorre, Beuvry, France" title="Gorre, Beuvry, France">Gorre</a> Chateau. During the next two nights a continuous trench
         was dug and wired, to connect our right flank with the 55th Division. <a href="people-index.html#Robinson, Mark, Capt" title="Robinson, Mark, Capt" id="pers480">
            Captain
            M.
            Robinson
            </a> rejoined the Battalion on the <span title="1918-05-13">13th</span>,
         and on the <span title="1918-05-14">14th</span> we were relieved by the 1/5th
         Leicestershire Regiment, becoming Battalion in support with Battalion
         Headquarters and A Company at Le
         Quesnoy, B Company in the eastern edge of <a id="place587" href="place-index.html?n=Gorre, Beuvry, France" title="Gorre, Beuvry, France">Gorre</a> and C and D in the Reserve line <abbr title="East">E.</abbr> of <a id="place588" href="place-index.html?n=Gorre, Beuvry, France" title="Gorre, Beuvry, France">Gorre</a>, the latter two
         Companies being under the command of <a href="people-index.html#Jones, Charles Herbert, Lt-Col (Leicestershire Regiment)" title="Jones, Charles Herbert, Lt-Col (Leicestershire Regiment)" id="pers928"><abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment</a> in case of attack. After four
         days in this position, we were relieved by the 1/5th North Staffordshire
         Regiment and moved to Verquin, being held at two hours' notice to move in case
         of attack, which, however, did not materialise; 2nd Lieut. Murray and two Other
         Ranks were wounded by shell fire. Training was carried on on the usual lines
         until we relieved the 1/5th South Staffordshire Regiment in the Gorre right
         sub-sector on the <span title="1918-05-22">22nd</span>.</p>
      
      <p>The distribution of Companies was unchanged, but Battalion Headquarters were
         moved to the Brewery near <a id="place589" href="place-index.html?n=Gorre, Beuvry, France" title="Gorre, Beuvry, France">Gorre</a> bridge,
         as the Chateau and wood had been heavily shelled and were still full of gas.
         With the exception of intermittent artillery activity the enemy were quiet and
         much work was done on improvement of the trenches. At 3.30 a.m. on <span title="1918-05-26">May 26th</span> a party of the enemy 15 to 20 strong,
         crept up to within a few yards of one of A Company posts, under cover of a ditch
         and long grass, and attempted to rush the post, firing revolvers and throwing
         bombs, and shouting "hands up". <a href="people-index.html#Burdass, William John, 242506" title="Burdass, William John, 242506" id="pers481">Lance-Corporal
            W. J.
            Burdass</a>, although the enemy were almost on
         the top of the post, immediately got his Lewis gun into 
         [<a id="p161" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/161/mode/1up">p161</a>]
          action, killed two of the enemy, both <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officers">N.C.O.'s</abbr>, and assisted by rifle fire from the other men at the post drove the
         enemy back; he was awarded the Military Medal for conspicuous gallantry, as his
         coolness and prompt action certainly saved the garrison from suffering severe
         casualties before the enemy could be driven off. The identifications obtained
         from the dead enemy <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officers">N.C.O.'s</abbr> showed them to belong to the 6th Reserve Infantry Regiment. Later on
         the <span title="1918-05-26">26th</span> an inter-company relief took place;
         enemy artillery was very active both on the trenches and on Battalion
         Headquarters for the next two days.</p>
      
      <p>The morning of <span title="1918-05-30">May 30th</span> was very misty and at 2.30
         a.m. an enemy barrage of trench mortar bombs was put down on the right Company
         front, and subsequently switched on to Route A Keep, garrisoned by D Company,
         and at the same time movement in front was observed and the <abbr title="Save Our Souls">S.O.S.</abbr> was sent to our artillery. Two minutes later an artillery barrage was
         put down behind the trench mortar barrage, and the enemy was seen to be
         advancing. It was difficult in the mist to determine the enemy strength, but he
         appeared to have a large party, stated afterwards by a prisoner to number
         between 40 and 50 men. The enemy advanced to our wire, but lost formation in
         trying to get through, and was met by steady rifle and machine gun fire; our own
         artillery and machine gun barrage was very quick and good, being put down just
         in front of our wire, and the enemy quickly abandoned the attempt. Only one
         man got through the wire and was made prisoner, so that an
         identification of the 395th <abbr title="Infantry Regiment">I.R.</abbr>, 9th Reserve Division, was obtained. Throughout the operation the men
         behaved splendidly, and <a href="people-index.html#Utting, Reginald Denney, Lt" title="Utting, Reginald Denney, Lt" id="pers482">

         themselves: <a href="people-index.html#Vacey, Robert, 201199" title="Vacey, Robert, 201199" id="pers486">Private

         work; <a href="people-index.html#Tuplin, Ernest, 241323" title="Tuplin, Ernest, 241323" id="pers487">Private

         through the barrage, and after delivering the message returned again to the
         front line showing courage of a high order; both men were awarded the Military
         Medal.</p>
      
      <p>A patrol was sent out as soon as the enemy had retired, and the body of a German
         officer was brought in; it is certain that the enemy suffered many other
         casualties but the mist gave him the opportunity to get his dead and wounded
         away. Our casualties were 3 Other Ranks killed, and <a href="people-index.html#Utting, Reginald Denney, Lt" title="Utting, Reginald Denney, Lt" id="pers930">1 Officer</a> and
         7 Other Ranks wounded. On the evening of the same day we were relieved by the
         1/8th Sherwood Foresters, and proceeded to billets in <a id="place590" href="place-index.html?n=Verquin, France" title="Verquin, France">Verquin</a>, where we remained under two hour's

            to be congratulated on the stout defence they put up, and upon their
            courageous endurance which enabled them to man their defences immediately
            the hostile bombardment lifted. It is this soldierly behaviour, coupled with
            expert use of rifles and machine guns, which constitutes our real safety.
            Please have the garrison congratulated for me on their defence."</p>

      <p>The enemy were fairly quiet until <span title="1918-06-07">June 7th</span>, when
         we relieved the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment in the line in the <a id="place599" href="place-index.html?n=Essars, France" title="Essars, France">Essarts</a> left sub-sector, A Company at
         Mesplaux Farm and B Company at
         Les Facons in the front line, D
         Company in support holding the Liverpool line, and C Company in reserve. The
         dispositions had been altered since our last tour in this sector, the outpost
         line being less strongly held, and the centre patrolled only, while the main
         line of defence, the Liverpool line, was more strongly garrisoned. On the
         morning of the <span title="1918-06-08">8th</span> the enemy artillery was very
         active on our front in retaliation 
         [<a id="p164" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/164/mode/1up">p164</a>]
          for a gas
         projection on our left. Enemy activity was observed in a group of houses 500
         yards <abbr title="East">E.</abbr> of Mesplaux Farm, and a
         patrol reported that a large party was wiring in front of the houses, so our
         artillery was brought to bear. During the day, <a href="people-index.html#Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" title="Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" id="pers489">Major
            H. G.
            Wilson</a> rejoined the Battalion and resumed
         the duties of 2nd in Command after several months absence in England after his
         accident. On <span title="1918-06-09">June 9th</span> our heavy artillery
         bombarded the houses mentioned above and at night a party of A Company under
         <a href="people-index.html#Madden, Clarence Rowland, Lt" title="Madden, Clarence Rowland, Lt" id="pers490">
            Lieut.

         been set on fire by our artillery and the enterprise had to be abandoned. On the

         being under two hours' notice to move to the Bridge-head line about Le Quesnoy and

         including one hour's marching wearing box respirators, a most useful but
         disagreeable exercise.</p>
      
      <p>On the evening of <span title="1918-06-15">June 15th</span> we relieved the 1/6th

         trench unoccupied but five rifles and a number of Verey lights, which had been
         left there, were removed. On the <span title="1918-06-19">19th</span> the whole
         sector was heavily shelled, causing some casualties, and in the evening we were
         relieved by the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment and went back to support, two
         forward Companies being along the <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> bank of the Beuvry river, one Company

         witness a night tank demonstration, while the Battalion indulged in another
         hour's marching wearing box-respirators as part of the training programme. We
         relieved the 1/6th North Staffordshire Regiment in the <a id="place616" href="place-index.html?n=Essars, France" title="Essars, France">Essarts</a> left sub-sector on the night of <span title="1918-06-27">June 27th</span>, completing the relief at 1.30 a.m. on
