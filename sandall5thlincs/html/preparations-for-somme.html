      <h2>The Preparation for the Battle of the Somme</h2>
      
      <p>On <span title="1916-04-20">April 20th, 1916</span>, we left <a id="place238" href="place-index.html?n=Camblain-l'Abbe, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Camblain-l'Abbe, Pas-de-Calais, France">Camblain l'Abée</a> at 10 a.m. and marched away
         from the battle area in a <abbr title="South-East">S.E.</abbr> direction for 14 miles, billeting for the night in pleasant
         surroundings at <a id="place239" href="place-index.html?n=Monts-en-Ternois, France" title="Monts-en-Ternois, France">Mont en Tenois</a>. <span title="1916-04-21">Next day</span> the Battalion was very thoroughly
         inspected by companies by the <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers825">Commanding Officer</a>, but no other work was done, and on
         <span title="1916-04-22">April 22nd</span> we moved on to <a id="place240" href="place-index.html?n=Penin, France" title="Penin, France">Penin</a>, where again excellent billets were
         available, and the next two days were spent in interior economy, special
         attention being paid to cleanliness of arms and equipment in the effort to
         promote greater smartness in appearance. Baths were available for the men at the
         brewery in the neighbouring village of <a id="place241" href="place-index.html?n=Tincques, France" title="Tincques, France">Tinques</a>. A rifle range was also available at <a id="place242" href="place-index.html?n=Penin, France" title="Penin, France">Penin</a>, and the opportunity was taken of
         putting all men through a short musketry course, while company training,
         especially close order drill, was carried out daily until the <span title="1916-04-28">28th</span> with good results.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1916-04-29">April 29th</span> training was interrupted, as the
         Battalion was required to provide parties for work on the Corps Line near
         <a id="place243" href="place-index.html?n=Mont-Saint-Eloi, France" title="Mont-Saint-Eloi, France">Mont St. Eloi</a>, for which purpose we
         moved to another area. Half the Battalion being required for work the same night
         were carried up to the area by motor-'bus, while the other half, who would not
         be wanted till <span title="1916-04-29">next day</span>, marched. The billeting
         area was very scattered, Battalion Headquarters and details being at 
         [<a id="p67" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/67/mode/1up">p67</a>]
         
         <a id="place244" href="place-index.html?n=Maroeuil, France" title="Maroeuil, France">Maroeuil</a>, a village exposed to distant
         shell fire, as was demonstrated by one shell exploding in the garden of the
         house occupied as Battalion Headquarters, fortunately doing no damage; the
         Transport and Quartermaster's Stores were at the hamlet of <a id="place245" href="place-index.html?n=Bray, Mont-Saint-Eloi, France" title="Bray, Mont-Saint-Eloi, France">Bray</a>, two miles away; two Companies were in
         dug-outs in a large wood, the Bois des Allieux, <abbr title="North">N.</abbr> of <a id="place246" href="place-index.html?n=Mont-Saint-Eloi, France" title="Mont-Saint-Eloi, France">Mont St. Eloi</a>, which was
         quite a pleasant rural retreat: one Company occupied huts, an unexpected luxury,
         in a copse at <a id="place247" href="place-index.html?n=Ecoivres, Mont-Saint-Eloi, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Ecoivres, Mont-Saint-Eloi, Pas-de-Calais, France">Ecoivres</a>; and the fourth
         Company occupied dug-outs by the Chausée, a road running parallel to the Corps
         Line, about half-a-mile in front of <a id="place248" href="place-index.html?n=Maroeuil, France" title="Maroeuil, France">Maroeuil</a>. The whole Battalion worked on the Corps Line trenches
         from <span title="1916-04-29">April 29th</span> to <span title="1916-05-07">May
            7th</span>, part by night on those sections exposed to enemy observation,
         and the remainder by day. During the week <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers203">Lieut.-Col.
            T. E.
            Sandall</a> proceeded to a Commanding
         Officer's Conference at <a id="place249" href="place-index.html?n=Auxi-le-Chateau, France" title="Auxi-le-Chateau, France">Auxi-le-Chateau</a>, where the Second Army School was situated, and
         <a href="people-index.html#Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" title="Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" id="pers204">Major
            H. G.
            Wilson</a> was in temporary command.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1916-05-08">May 8th</span>, the necessary work in the Corps Line
         being completed, the Battalion marched back to <a id="place250" href="place-index.html?n=Penin, France" title="Penin, France">Penin</a> occupying their former billets for the night, and on the
         <span title="1916-05-09">next day</span> marched to <a id="place251" href="place-index.html?n=Sus-Saint-Leger, France" title="Sus-Saint-Leger, France">Sus St. Leger</a>, a village near <a id="place252" href="place-index.html?n=Lucheux, France" title="Lucheux, France">Lucheux</a>, where ample, clean and comfortable
         billets were available, and for the next few weeks we rested in comfort and
         contentment probably greater than any we enjoyed at any other time during our
         service in the Field. The weather was for the most part delightful, the billets
         were comfortable, the work was comparatively light, the surrounding country
         charming and well wooded, looking its best in early <span title="1916-05">May</span>, and last, but not least, we were well outside the zone of shell
         fire, and practically far enough back to be free even from the sound of guns.</p>
      
      [<a id="p68" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/68/mode/1up">p68</a>]
      
      
      <p>On <span title="1916-05-10">May 10th</span> three Companies were detailed for work
         in the forest of <a id="place253" href="place-index.html?n=Lucheux, France" title="Lucheux, France">Lucheux</a>, a delightful
         stretch of woodland and a beautiful specimen of French forestry at its best,
         which extended to within a mile of the village, while one Company devoted itself
         to Company training, and this routine with occasional modifications was
         continued for the next fortnight. The Battalion usually paraded at 9 a.m. and
         marched into the forest, working till 1 p.m. when one hour was allowed for
         dinner, which was cooked in the field kitchens which we took out with us, and
         worked again from 2 to 4.30 p.m., when we returned to billets. After tea the
         band usually played which added much to our enjoyment.</p>
      
      <p>The work in the Forest consisted of felling saplings, trimming them, and finally
         weaving them into hurdles, or tying them into fascines, which were destined to
         be used in the assembly trenches then being prepared for the forth-coming attack
         on the Somme, rumours of which had reached our ears; the work was carried on
         under the superintendence of an <abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr> detachment and the men soon became apt pupils. At the first accidents
         were frequent, as felling axes and bill-hooks are somewhat dangerous weapons in
         unskilled hands, and their use is fraught with considerable danger to a careless
         or incompetent wielder, but the quantity of completed hurdles and fascines
         gradually increased each day for the same hours of work, and the average man in
         the Battalion accounted himself a fair woodman by the end of our experience in
         Forestry.</p>
      
      <p>During this period each Company in turn was struck off duty for a few days for
         anti-typhoid inoculation or re-inoculation, the immense value of which had
         already been conclusively proved; many sore arms, much bad language, and more
         grousing was the immediate result but the future good health 
         [<a id="p69" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/69/mode/1up">p69</a>]
          of the Battalion, and our practical immunity from enteric
         fever during the whole campaign was the ultimate result, well worth it all. On
         <span title="1916-05-15">May 15th</span>, a strong draft of four officers and
         330 other ranks reached the Battalion, while four more officers of the Middlesex
         Regiment joined on the <span title="1916-05-19">19th</span>, thus once more
         bringing us up to a reasonable fighting strength. On <span title="1916-05-17">May
            17th</span>, the routine was varied by a Battalion operation, the
         opportunity being taken of practising wood-fighting, and marching through the
         Forest on a compass bearing, under the supervision of the <a href="people-index.html#Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" title="Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" id="pers826">Divisional
            Commander</a>.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1916-05-20">May 20th</span> our delightful rural sojourn at
         <a id="place254" href="place-index.html?n=Sus-Saint-Leger, France" title="Sus-Saint-Leger, France">Sus St. Leger</a> came to an end; it
         was a period of unalloyed happy memory to all, except the victims of inoculation
         already referred to, and the Battalion returned on <span title="1916-05-20">20th</span> to the trench area marching through <a id="place255" href="place-index.html?n=Pas-en-Artois, France" title="Pas-en-Artois, France">Pas-en-Artois</a>, where Divisional Headquarters were situated, to
         <a id="place256" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a>, a village two miles
         behind the front line, opposite <a id="place257" href="place-index.html?n=Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France">Gommecourt</a>. The country in this sector was very different from the
         bare flat fields in front of <a id="place258" href="place-index.html?n=Kemmel, Heuvelland, Belgium" title="Kemmel, Heuvelland, Belgium">Kemmel</a>,
         the sodden plain of <a id="place259" href="place-index.html?n=Ieper, Belgium" title="Ieper, Belgium">Ypres</a>, or the
         chalky slopes of the <a id="place260" href="place-index.html?n=Vimy, France" title="Vimy, France">Vimy</a> Ridge,
         consisting as it did of numerous villages embowered in trees, with undulating
         cultivated fields between; a distant view gave one an impression of a large
         tract of uninhabited country, the houses being hidden in innumerable small
         woods, which dotted the landscape.</p>
      
      <p><a id="place261" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a>, although within two miles
         of the front line, was still occupied by a considerable number of its original
         inhabitants, and the land was cultivated to within a short distance of the
         trenches, as the enemy, owing to the wooded nature of the terrain, had no direct
         observation, and aeroplanes were still few and far between. For many months this
         had been one of the quietest parts on the British 
         [<a id="p70" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/70/mode/1up">p70</a>]
          Front, but as our preparations for attack became apparent to
         the enemy, his artillery activity gradually increased, and life was not quite so
         peaceful from this time forward.</p>
      
      <p>For the next fortnight training was entirely put aside, the whole Battalion being
         employed on the construction of assembly trenches and communication trenches
         leading to <a id="place262" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a>, a village
         about half-a-mile behind the front line directly in front of <a id="place263" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a>. Half the Battalion worked by day,
         where they were not under observation, the other half by night, where new
         trenches were sited in the open; by <span title="1916-05-28">May 28th</span> all
         trenches were so far advanced that further work on them could be safely carried
         on by day. The <a href="people-index.html#Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" title="Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" id="pers827"><abbr title="General Officer Commanding">G.O.C.</abbr> Division</a> was so pleased with the progress made that one day's
         complete holiday was allowed the Battalion, a rest much enjoyed by everybody.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1916-05-31">May 31st</span> an important reorganization within the
         Battalion was effected, the Lewis Gun Section, the successor of the original
         Machine Gun Section, being broken up and distributed among Companies, as the
         establishment of eight Lewis Guns per Battalion now available allowed two guns
         to be allotted to each Company, of which they became henceforth an integral
         part, although the Lewis Gun Officer, at this time <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Robert Edward Wychenford, Lt" title="Sandall, Robert Edward Wychenford, Lt" id="pers205">Lieut.
            R. E.
            W.
            Sandall</a>, remained attached to Battalion
         Headquarters for their general supervision.</p>
      
      <p>Work on trenches continued daily up to <span title="1916-06-03">June 3rd</span>,
         the Midland Trench, an assembly trench immediately in rear of <a id="place264" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonqevillers</a> village, and the communication
         trenches up to it, being completed. The sector still remained fairly quiet, but
         in the early morning of <span title="1916-06-03">June 3rd</span>
         <a id="place265" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a> was somewhat heavily
         shelled and several billets were hit, causing some casualties, among others
         Lieuts. <a href="people-index.html#Coulson, John Baxter, 2nd Lt (d 1916)" title="Coulson, John Baxter, 2nd Lt (d 1916)" id="pers206">J. B.</a> and <a href="people-index.html#Coulson, Frank Reginald, 2nd Lt" title="Coulson, Frank Reginald, 2nd Lt" id="pers207">F.

         [<a id="p71" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/71/mode/1up">p71</a>]
         
         wounded, the former unfortunately so severely that he subsequently died of
         wounds.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1916-06-04">June 4th</span> the Battalion once more returned to
         duty in the trench line, relieving the 1/7th Sherwood Foresters at 8.30 p.m.,
         being distributed with two Companies in the front line, one Company in support
         in dug-outs about 400 yards in the rear, and one Company in reserve with
         Battalion Headquarters in <a id="place266" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a>
         village, which lay about 800 yards behind the front line. The work in progress
         in the trench area consisted of the preparation of several lines of assembly
         trenches behind the front line, while a new trench in No Man's Land, here some
         400 to 500 yards wide, was taped out on the night of <span title="1916-06-07">June 7th</span> about 200 yards in advance of our original front line, the
         Battalion supplying covering parties to enable this to be done.</p>
      
      <p>On the night of <span title="1916-06-08">June 8th</span> a covering party of two
         platoons with Lewis Guns was pushed well forward, while one and a half companies
         and the whole the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment dug about 400 yards of the new
         trench down to a depth of 3 feet 6 inches, during the night. The enemy evidently
         was aware of the proceedings to some extent, and the work was carried on under
         heavy shrapnel and machine gun fire, which caused us 15 casualties. The 1/4th
         Lincolnshire Battalion suffered somewhat heavily, their Commanding Officer,
         <a href="people-index.html#Gardner, Henry Monifort, Lt-Col" title="Gardner, Henry Monifort, Lt-Col" id="pers208">Lieut.-Colonel
            H. Gardner</a>,
         being dangerously wounded. On the next two nights, <span title="1916-06-09">June
            9th</span> and <span title="1916-06-10">10th</span>, with the usual covering
         parties out, the digging was completed, and the trench sufficiently wired to
         enable it to be occupied for observation purposes, the garrison consisting of
         one platoon by day, and three platoons by night. By day work on the assembly
         trenches was continued, trench mortar positions and ammunition stores were
         prepared, <abbr title="Small Arms Ammunition">S.A.A.</abbr> and bomb 
         [<a id="p72" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/72/mode/1up">p72</a>]
          stores were constructed in
         the front line, and communication trenches were improved; by night we supplied
         covering parties, while working parties of the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment
         continued the wiring and improvement of the advanced trench, known as the Bush
         Trench. Meanwhile it was evident that the enemy by this time had observed the
         immense amount of work being done, and the days of the "quiet
         sector" were over, the enemy shelling growing day by day more heavy and
         persistent, and it was therefore with considerable satisfaction that after a
         spell of 14 days continuous work in the front line we were informed that we were
         to be relieved on the night of <span title="1916-06-18">June 18th</span>. The
         company in the sector <abbr title="North">N.</abbr> of the <a id="place267" href="place-index.html?n=La Brayelle, Bucquoy, France" title="La Brayelle, Bucquoy, France">La Brayelle</a> road was
         relieved by a company of 11th Royal Warwickshire Regiment, from the Division on
         our left, while the remainder of the Battalion was relieved by the 1/8th
         Sherwood Foresters and we withdrew to rest billets in huts at <a id="place268" href="place-index.html?n=Humbercamps, France" title="Humbercamps, France">Humbercamp</a>, a prettily situated and
         practically unshelled village about three miles behind the line.</p>
      
      <p>During the next few days a certain amount of training was performed, but the
         Battalion was chiefly employed in digging cable trenches, and on the
         construction of dug-outs to serve as Divisional Battle Headquarters at
         <a id="place269" href="place-index.html?n=Saint-Amand, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Saint-Amand, Pas-de-Calais, France">St. Amand</a>. The huts at <a id="place270" href="place-index.html?n=Humbercamps, France" title="Humbercamps, France">Humbercamp</a> were pleasant quarters, but the
         immediate proximity of a 15 inch gun of ours, which fired constantly, was not
         one of the amenities. The plans for the attack on <a id="place271" href="place-index.html?n=Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France">Gommecourt</a> in which the 46th Division was to participate were
         explained at a Commanding Officers' Conference at Brigade Headquarters at
         <a id="place272" href="place-index.html?n=Warlincourt-les-Pas, France" title="Warlincourt-les-Pas, France">Warlincourt</a> on the <span title="1916-06-23">23rd</span> and on the <span title="1916-06-24">24th</span>
         the preliminary bombardment of the Battle of the Somme began and continued day
         by day. The Battalion supplied working parties until the 
         [<a id="p73" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/73/mode/1up">p73</a>]
         
         <span title="1916-06-26">26th</span>, when we moved from <a id="place273" href="place-index.html?n=Humbercamps, France" title="Humbercamps, France">Humbercamp</a> to huts at <a id="place274" href="place-index.html?n=Warlincourt-les-Pas, France" title="Warlincourt-les-Pas, France">Warlincourt</a>, where two hours light training
         was performed daily, but otherwise all enjoyed as much rest as possible.</p>
      
      <p>On the <span title="1916-06-28">28th</span> the final orders for the attack on
         <a id="place275" href="place-index.html?n=Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France">Gommecourt</a> were received, the
         assembly point of the Battalion being the Corps Line Trench, running <abbr title="North">N.</abbr> and <abbr title="South">S.</abbr>, 500 yards <abbr title="East">E.</abbr> of <a id="place276" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a>, between the
         <a id="place277" href="place-index.html?n=Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" title="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France">Bienvillers</a>-<a id="place278" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a> and <a id="place279" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a>-<a id="place280" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Sousatre</a>
         roads. A forward party of 50 was sent up at noon to this position with bombs,
         tools, and reserve rations, while a reserve ration of water was sent up to the
         Midland trench behind <a id="place281" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a>.
         The men were served with two Mills' bombs, four sandbags and 170 rounds of <abbr title="Small Arms Ammunition">S.A.A.</abbr> each, while every fourth man was provided with a pick or shovel, and
         the Lewis Guns provided with 49 magazines per gun carried in canvas buckets, and
         the Battalion was ordered to reach <a id="place282" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a> at 11.45 p.m. At 3.45 p. m., however, an order was
         received by wire from Divisional Headquarters, "Postpone all moves
         until further notice"; the forward party were therefore recalled, the
         stores being left under guard in the respective trenches, and the Battalion
         remained in the <a id="place283" href="place-index.html?n=Warlincourt-les-Pas, France" title="Warlincourt-les-Pas, France">Warlincourt</a> huts
         awaiting orders.</p>
      
      <p>On the <span title="1916-06-29">29th</span> we rested, except for two hours' light
         training awaiting, the final orders to move, which arrived later in the day,
         finally fixing the Divisional attack on <a id="place284" href="place-index.html?n=Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France">Gommecourt</a> for <span title="1916-07-01">July 1st</span>. On <span title="1916-06-30">June 30th</span>, at 6 p.m., the advance party proceeded
         to their stations and at 9 p.m., the Battalion marched from the huts at
         <a id="place285" href="place-index.html?n=Warlincourt-les-Pas, France" title="Warlincourt-les-Pas, France">Warlincourt</a>, to the strains of the
         Lincolnshire Poacher from the Band, who played us out, to take up their assembly
         position in the Corps Line Trench before <a id="place286" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a> for the opening of the Battle of the Somme.</p>
