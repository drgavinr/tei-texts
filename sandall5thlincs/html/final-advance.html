      <h2>The Final Advance</h2>
      
      <p>At 4 p.m. on <span title="1918-11-03">November 3rd</span> the Battalion left
         <a id="place695" href="place-index.html?n=Becquigny, Aisne, Picardie, France" title="Becquigny, Aisne, Picardie, France">Becquiny</a> and marched to a field
         just <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> of <a id="place696" href="place-index.html?n=Saint-Martin-Riviere, France" title="Saint-Martin-Riviere, France">St. Martin-Riviere</a>,
         arriving at 7.30 p.m. The march was conducted in pouring rain, but fortunately
         the weather cleared before it was completed, and the Battalion bivouacked for
         the night. At 6.30 a.m. next morning, <span title="1918-11-04">November
            4th</span>, in a thick mist we moved to our assembly positions just <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> of <a id="place697" href="place-index.html?n=Mazinghien, France" title="Mazinghien, France">Mazinghien</a>, the 46th
         Division being in support to the 1st and 32nd Divisions, who were attacking the
         enemy positions on the Sambre-Oise Canal. At 11 a.m. the Battalion moved forward
         to the position near <a id="place698">Louviere</a> which had
         been previously fixed as that from which a subsequent move would be made,
         depending on the success of the attack. At 4 p.m. orders were received for the
         Battalion to relieve the Black Watch in the line of the 1st Infantry Brigade,
         and although the sector had not been reconnoitred the relief was conducted
         smoothly being completed at 11 p.m., A, B, and C Companies being in the line
         with D Company in support. From midnight onward it rained heavily, but during
         the hours of darkness A and B Companies pushed forward patrols who at dawn
         advanced 800 yards, capturing four 77mm and three 10.5cm guns, as well as four
         machine guns. As soon as it was light on <span title="1918-11-05">November
            5th</span>, the forward companies pushed ahead and occupied a line through
         Toaillon Farm and <a id="place699">Zobeail</a>. At 8 a.m.
         the 137th Brigade passed through our lines, and 
         [<a id="p189" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/189/mode/1up">p189</a>]
          continued the advance, while the Battalion withdrew to billets in <a id="place700">Mezieres La Grosse</a>.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1918-11-06">November 6th</span>, the advance was continued, the
         138th Brigade being in support to the 137th and 139th brigades. The Battalion
         left <a id="place701">Mezieres La Grosse</a> at 6.30 a.m.,
         and marched to <a id="place702">Lagoelle</a>, where a halt
         was made until 2 p.m. It rained hard all day and the men were wet through and
         very glad to reach <a id="place703" href="place-index.html?n=Prisches, France" title="Prisches, France">Priches</a>, where
         billets had been arranged for the night. On reaching <a id="place704" href="place-index.html?n=Prisches, France" title="Prisches, France">Priches</a>, however, orders were received to
         continue the march to <a id="place705" href="place-index.html?n=Cartignies, France" title="Cartignies, France">Cartignies</a>, and
         be ready on the following morning to pass through the 137th and 139th Brigades
         and continue the advance. A quiet night was spent at <a id="place706" href="place-index.html?n=Cartignies, France" title="Cartignies, France">Cartignies</a> in comfortable billets, although
         the Germans were only just outside the town.</p>
      
      <p>Soon after midnight on <span title="1918-11-06">November 6th</span>-<span title="1918-11-07">7th</span>, our patrols passed through the outposts of the
         leading Brigades, who were holding a line along the west bank of the Petit Helpe
         River, to reconnoitre the river banks and find a means of crossing. It was found
         that all the bridges had been destroyed by the enemy except one small foot
         bridge, which could take Infantry in single file. The <a href="people-index.html#Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" title="Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" id="pers946">
            <abbr title="Commanding Officer">C.O.</abbr>
            </a> therefore decided that the four companies should cross this bridge just
         before dawn and get into position on the east side of the river, ready to move
         forward at dawn. At 5 a.m. on <span title="1918-11-07">November 7th</span> the
         138th Brigade took over the whole Divisional front, passing through the 137th
         and 139th Brigade out-posts, the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment on the right, the
         1/5th Lincolnshire on the left, and the 1/4th Leicestershire in support. At 4.30
         a.m. a patrol was sent forward to the foot bridge to reconnoitre for any signs
         of the enemy, and had instructions to report to Battalion Headquarters as soon
         as the companies had crossed and were in position on the further bank. When 
         [<a id="p190" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/190/mode/1up">p190</a>]
          the patrol arrived at the site of the bridge
         they found to their dismay that the river had risen in flood, and had washed
         away the foot bridge leaving no means whatever of crossing, but there were no
         signs of the enemy, and civilians who appeared on the east bank stated that the
         Germans had left at 3 a.m. When the companies reached the river bank, A Company
         on the left rapidly constructed a rough temporary bridge by throwing carts into
         the river, and putting planks and ladders on them, the French civilian
         inhabitants doing the same from the opposite bank. The bridge was not very safe
         but A Company managed to cross without accidents and were very shortly in
         position on the east bank, where they were rapturously greeted by the
         inhabitants. On the right B and C Companies were less fortunate in finding carts
         and other material for an improvised bridge, so trees were felled and placed
         across. There was great difficulty owing to the strength of the current in
         getting the trees into position, and <a href="people-index.html#Dunn, Robin Gaspar, Capt (d 1919)" title="Dunn, Robin Gaspar, Capt (d 1919)" id="pers561">
            Captain
            Dunn</a>, <abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> B Company, who had jumped into the river to try and fix them, was
         nearly swept away; <a href="people-index.html#Goodall, Charles Eric Griffiths, Capt" title="Goodall, Charles Eric Griffiths, Capt" id="pers562">
            Captain
            Goodall</a>, <abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> C Company, then sprang into the river to his assistance, and between
         them they managed to fix the trees so that a foot bridge could be made. While it
         was being completed <a href="people-index.html#Dunn, Robin Gaspar, Capt (d 1919)" title="Dunn, Robin Gaspar, Capt (d 1919)" id="pers563">
            Captain
            Dunn
            </a> walked forward to <a id="place707">Bellevue</a>
         and found it clear of the enemy. By 8 a.m. the whole Battalion was across the
         river, and the advance began, C and D Companies in front with A and B in support
         and the first objective was reached without any opposition. As soon as touch was
         established on either flank the advance was resumed to the second objective,
         which was reached at mid-day. Patrols were sent forward and reported that the
         high ground in front was strongly held. Our line tried to advance, but the enemy
         line was strongly held 
         [<a id="p191" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/191/mode/1up">p191</a>]
          by numerous machine
         gun posts, which were cleverly placed commanding the valley and low ground, and
         it was found impossible to take the position without artillery support.
         Accordingly our line was slightly withdrawn, and an outpost position taken up
         for the night, and dug in, A, B and C Companies in the line, with D in support.
         Our casualties were 2 officers, <a href="people-index.html#Dunn, Robin Gaspar, Capt (d 1919)" title="Dunn, Robin Gaspar, Capt (d 1919)" id="pers564">
            Captain
            Dunn
            </a> and <a href="people-index.html#Bull, Capt" title="Bull, Capt" id="pers565">
            Captain
            Bull</a>, wounded and 4 Other Ranks killed and 6 wounded.</p>
      
      <p>During the night of <span title="1918-11-07">November 7th</span>-<span title="1918-11-08">8th</span>, touch with the enemy was kept by means of
         patrols, who reported at dawn on the <span title="1918-11-08">8th</span> that the
         enemy were still holding the same line. At 11 a.m. a light artillery barrage was
         put down on the enemy position, but we only had a few field guns across the
         river, and the barrage was so weak that it had little or no effect, and when our
         troops tried to advance, they were again met by heavy machine gun fire, and also
         by some trench mortar bombs. A Company however got in contact with two or three
         enemy posts and inflicted casualties. <a href="people-index.html#Griffiths, William B, 40615" title="Griffiths, William B, 40615" id="pers566">Lance-Corporal
            W. Griffiths</a>,
         when his platoon was held up by two machine guns, took a Lewis gun, went forward
         to a position from which he could fire on them, and so enabled his platoon to
         advance. Later in the day owing to all his superiors becoming casualties, he
         took command of the platoon, and showed great skill in consolidating the
         position he gained. He was awarded the Military Medal as was also <a href="people-index.html#Adams, John William, 241171" title="Adams, John William, 241171" id="pers567">Private
            J. W.
            Adams</a>, who set a fine example of courage
         and determination as a Company runner, carrying messages and reconnoitring under
         heavy fire. <a href="people-index.html#Brown, Frederick Arthur, 242445" title="Brown, Frederick Arthur, 242445" id="pers568">Lance-Corporal
            A. F.

         himself on previous occasions, especially before <a id="place708" href="place-index.html?n=Vaux-Andigny, France" title="Vaux-Andigny, France">Andigny</a> on <span title="1918-10-17">October 17th</span>, when

         heavy fire, brought his fire to bear on 
         [<a id="p192" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/192/mode/1up">p192</a>]
          the
         enemy machine gun, and so enabled his Platoon to advance, and was also awarded
         the Military Medal.</p>
      
      <p>When it was found that the Germans intended to hold on to the strong position
         they occupied in our front, it was decided to wait until more guns could be got
         across the river, and then make an attack in force; the barrage and attack was
         fixed for 4 p.m. Meanwhile the 32nd Division on our left were at 1 p.m.
         advancing in close formation, and it was also reported that the French on our
         right were also advancing; in both cases the enemy had retired in front of them,
         but continued to hold on to the position on our front until 1.30 p.m., when he
         evacuated it. Our troops followed up closely, but met with no further
         opposition, and the final objective for the day was reached at 6 p.m. An outpost
         line was taken up and orders were received that the Brigade would be relieved by
         the 137th Brigade at dawn, but before the relief was effected our Brigade was
         ordered to take up a fresh outpost position further forward on a line <abbr title="East">E</abbr> of <a id="place709" href="place-index.html?n=Sains-du-Nord, France" title="Sains-du-Nord, France">Sans Du Nord</a> and
         <a id="place710" href="place-index.html?n=Semeries, France" title="Semeries, France">Semeries</a>. The Battalion was
         accordingly pushed forward, C and D Companies establishing an outpost line east
         of <a id="place711" href="place-index.html?n=Semeries, France" title="Semeries, France">Semeries</a>, while A and B Companies
         with Battalion Headquarters found billets in the village. The enemy were rapidly
         retiring and were reported at the time to be 15 kilometres away, touch with him
         being kept up by the cavalry and armoured cars.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1918-11-10">November 10th</span>, D Company took over the whole of
         the outpost line, and C Company withdrew to billets in <a id="place712" href="place-index.html?n=Semeries, France" title="Semeries, France">Semeries</a>. At 11.45 p.m. orders were received
         that hostilities would cease at 11 a.m. <span title="1918-11-11">next day</span>.
         At 8 a.m. on <span title="1918-11-11">November 11th</span> this order was
         confirmed, and the whole Brigade outpost line was taken over by the 1/4th
         Leicestershire Regiment. 
         [<a id="p193" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/193/mode/1up">p193</a>]
          At 9.30 a.m. the
         Battalion left <a id="place713" href="place-index.html?n=Semeries, France" title="Semeries, France">Semeries</a> and marched to
         <a id="place714" href="place-index.html?n=Sains-du-Nord, France" title="Sains-du-Nord, France">Sans Du Nord</a> arriving at 10.30
         a.m., where we were billeted in two large factories, two Companies in each, with
         Battalion Headquarters in the chateau. In the evening in celebration of the
         Armistice the Brigade Staff was entertained by the Battalion Headquarters Mess.
         The morning of the <span title="1918-11-12">12th</span> was spent in cleaning up
         and in preparation for an inspection and presentation of medal ribands by <a href="people-index.html#Boyd, Gerald Farrell, Maj-Gen" title="Boyd, Gerald Farrell, Maj-Gen" id="pers947"><abbr title="General Officer Commanding">G.O.C.</abbr> 46th Division</a> in the afternoon.

         completed at 4.30 p.m., and billets taken over, which were to be our home for
