      <h2>The Beginning of the Great Advance</h2>
      
      <p>On <span title="1918-07-09">July 9th</span> the Battalion relieved the 1/6th North
         Staffordshire Regiment in Brigade support in the <a id="place621" href="place-index.html?n=Gorre, Beuvry, France" title="Gorre, Beuvry, France">Gorre</a> sector, and on the <span title="1918-07-13">13th</span>
         the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment in the left sub-sector, A and B Companies in
         the line, C in support, and D in reserve. On the <span title="1918-07-17">17th</span> Battalion Headquarters and the left Company (B) were rather heavily
         shelled and an inter-company relief was effected in the evening. On the <span title="1918-07-18">18th</span>
         <a href="people-index.html#Pearson, George Joyce, Lt" title="Pearson, George Joyce, Lt" id="pers499">
            Lieut.

            2nd Lieut.
            Giles
            </a> carried out similar patrols and all three officers were complimented

         was quiet until the <span title="1918-07-21">21st</span>, when the enemy
         retaliated for the recent increase in our harrassing fire by shelling <a id="place622" href="place-index.html?n=Gorre, Beuvry, France" title="Gorre, Beuvry, France">Gorre</a> heavily. In the evening we were relieved
         by the 1/5th South Staffordshire Regiment, and returned to the former billets in
         Divisional Reserve, the officers taking the opportunity to reconnoitre the rear
         defences of the 3rd Division near <a id="place623" href="place-index.html?n=Chocques, France" title="Chocques, France">Chocques</a>. The Brigade sports were held on the afternoon of the
         <span title="1918-07-25">25th</span>, when the Battalion took first prize for
         the best Transport turn-out, and was second in the total number of points
         obtained from each event. On the <span title="1918-07-26">26th</span> the
         Battalion attended a demonstration to show the effects of controlled fire with
         "tracer" bullets at <a id="place624" href="place-index.html?n=Hesdigneul-les-Bethune, France" title="Hesdigneul-les-Bethune, France">Hesdigneul</a>, and a platoon of B Company repeated the demonstration
         with excellent results.</p>

      <p>We relieved the 1/5th South Staffordshire Regiment in Brigade support at

         the <span title="1918-07-30">30th</span>, when the right Company (A) was rather
         heavily shelled, and on <span title="1918-07-31">July 31st</span> we relieved the
         1/5th Leicestershire Regiment in the <a id="place626" href="place-index.html?n=Gorre, Beuvry, France" title="Gorre, Beuvry, France">Gorre</a> left sector at 11.30 p.m., C and D Companies in the line, A

            I. C.
            A. Perrott, <abbr title="Military Cross">M.C.</abbr></a>, carried out an excellent daylight patrol with two
         scouts, Privates <a href="people-index.html#Bell, James Henry, 202420" title="Bell, James Henry, 202420" id="pers507">J. Bell</a> and
         <a href="people-index.html#Howard, William, 241683" title="Howard, William, 241683" id="pers508">W. Howard</a>, penetrating 200 yards
         in the rear of the enemy front line in an endeavour to obtain an identification,
         which was urgently required. An enemy shelter was found with six men asleep,
         identifications were obtained, and the patrol withdrew, leaving a bomb in the
         dug-out, which did not explode. Meanwhile the patrol had been observed and
         parties of the enemy were seen advancing on both flanks, but covered by
         <a href="people-index.html#Perrott, Isambard Carlisle Anthony, Lt" title="Perrott, Isambard Carlisle Anthony, Lt" id="pers509">
            Lieut.

            Private
            Bell
            </a> again went forward to the dug-out and placed a bomb which exploded.
         By skilful leadership, use of ground, and covering fire, the patrol succeeded in
         reaching our lines without casualty, having obtained a valuable identification
         and information as to how the enemy held his line. Both the men were awarded the
         Military Medal.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1918-08-08">August 8th</span> Battalion Headquarters was shelled
         from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and finally had to move to a place of greater security.
         During the afternoon a daylight patrol of three men under <a href="people-index.html#Jackson, Sidney, 240681" title="Jackson, Sidney, 240681" id="pers512">Sergt.
            S. Jackson</a>
         penetrated the enemy line and obtained valuable information; unfortunately they
         were observed by the enemy before reaching their

          objective, one man was seriously wounded, and
         a considerable number of the enemy were seen advancing on the <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr> acting as the point of the patrol. <a href="people-index.html#Jackson, Sidney, 240681" title="Jackson, Sidney, 240681" id="pers513">
            Sergt.
            Jackson</a>, realising that an attempt at rescue would probably result in the
         whole patrol being captured and the importance of getting back with the
         information obtained, by means of skilful leadership and use of covering fire,
         succeeded in getting the rest of the patrol back to our lines. <a href="people-index.html#Woods, Albert Edward, 240986" title="Woods, Albert Edward, 240986" id="pers514">Private
            A. Woods</a>,
         when his comrade was wounded, having bound him up, maintained his position and
         held the enemy at bay with rifle fire, until the wounded man had
         reached a place of safety, thus by his courage and resource preventing the
         latter being captured. Both <a href="people-index.html#Jackson, Sidney, 240681" title="Jackson, Sidney, 240681" id="pers515">

      <p>On the evening of <span title="1918-08-08">August 8th</span> the Battalion was
         relieved by the 1/6th Sherwood Foresters, and went back to Divisional reserve,
         carrying out training as usual and providing large working parties at night for
         digging a cable trench near <a id="place627" href="place-index.html?n=Essars, France" title="Essars, France">Essarts</a>. On

            Lieut.
            Dennis
            </a> joined and <span title="1918-08-14">next day</span> we relieved the
         1/6th Sherwood Foresters in the <a id="place628" href="place-index.html?n=Gorre, Beuvry, France" title="Gorre, Beuvry, France">Gorre</a>
         left sub-sector, C and D Companies being in the front line, A Company in
         support, and B Company in reserve in the Liverpool line, Battalion Headquarters
         being in <a id="place629" href="place-index.html?n=La Loisne, France" title="La Loisne, France">Loisne</a> Chateau. From 3.45 a.m.
         to 5.15 a.m. the whole area was heavily shelled but no Infantry action followed;
         similar artillery activity occurred at intervals during the <span title="1918-08-17">17th</span>.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1918-08-18">August 18th</span> at 4 a.m., the enemy blew up an old
         British "Pill Box" just behind his front line, and also
         several shelters and dug-outs in the vicinity, and set fire to several houses in
         the Rue Du Bois. In view of these signs of impending retirement, patrols were
         sent out to investigate, but found the 
         [<a id="p170" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/170/mode/1up">p170</a>]
          enemy
         very alert and occupying his normal positions. At night the usual inter-company
         relief took place. On the <span title="1918-08-19">19th</span> patrols found the
         enemy still occupying his normal positions, but during the morning of <span title="1918-08-20">August 20th</span> he was seen retiring on our left. In
         consequence, patrols were again sent out and by noon had occupied the enemy's
         front line, and several farms <abbr title="South">S.</abbr> of the Rue Du Bois. Platoons were at once sent forward to occupy these
         positions, and push on to the Rue Du Bois, which had been laid down as the first
         objective of our advance. On the left B Company encountered some opposition from
         machine guns and snipers during the day, but were able to occupy their allotted
         positions in the evening and gain touch with the Battalion on their left. A
         Company on the right were held up, as the Battalion on our right did not move
         until midnight of <span title="1918-08-20">August 20th</span>-<span title="1918-08-21">21st</span>. They were heavily gas-shelled, and suffered a
         considerable number of casualties, so C Company were sent up with orders to
         advance through them and push on at once to Rue du Bois, which they successfully
         carried out, encountering little opposition so that by 5 a.m. on <span title="1918-08-21">August 21st</span> the whole Battalion were on their line,
         and in touch with the Battalions on both flanks from 200 to 500 yards from the
         enemy's advanced positions. During the day the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment
         took over the whole Brigade front, and on relief our companies were distributed
         A in <a id="place630" href="place-index.html?n=La Loisne, France" title="La Loisne, France">Loisne</a>, D in the Liverpool line, C
         in <a id="place631" href="place-index.html?n=Gorre, Beuvry, France" title="Gorre, Beuvry, France">Gorre</a> Farm, and B in Le Quesnoy Keep. The area was shelled at
         intervals during the next four days, a few casualties being sustained each day,
         and on the <span title="1918-08-26">26th</span> the Battalion was relieved,
         Headquarters and three Companies moving to <a id="place633" href="place-index.html?n=Verquin, France" title="Verquin, France">Verquin</a>, one Company, D, being left in Le Quesnoy Keep under the orders of the <abbr title="Brigadier General Commanding">B.G.C.</abbr> Left Brigade. From <span title="1918-08-27">August 27th</span>
         the Battalion 
         [<a id="p171" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/171/mode/1up">p171</a>]
          carried out four hours training
         daily, with musketry on the <a id="place635" href="place-index.html?n=Hesdigneul-les-Bethune, France" title="Hesdigneul-les-Bethune, France">Hesdigneul</a>
         range, until <span title="1918-09-01">September 1st</span>, when we relieved the
         1/6th Sherwood Foresters in the out-post line near Cailloux Keep, A and D Companies
         in the out-post line, and B
         and C in support in the old British front line, with Battalion Headquarters at
         <a id="place637" href="place-index.html?n=La Loisne, France" title="La Loisne, France">Loisne</a> Chateau.</p>
      
      <p><span title="1918-09-02">September 2nd</span> passed quietly, and early in the
         morning of the <span title="1918-09-03">3rd</span> we attempted to push our line
         forward in accordance with the scheme of operations for the 46th Division to
         conform with the movement of the 19th Division, which attacked on our left. The
         advance of the left Company was held up by enemy strong points, and very little
         progress was made, as the Division on our right was not moving forward. Patrols
         attempted to drive the enemy out on the left during the day, and failed, and an
         inter-company relief was arranged at dark, B and C Companies advancing and
         passing through A and D to establish a line if possible along Princes Road. As
         soon as D Company on the left passed through the front line they were met by
         rifle and machine gun fire from Rum Post and Path Post, and checked. The left
         platoon under <a href="people-index.html#Black, Adolphus George, 2nd Lt" title="Black, Adolphus George, 2nd Lt" id="pers519">2nd Lieut.
            A. G.
            Black</a>, who lead it most skilfully, worked
         round to the flank and rear of Rum Post. <a href="people-index.html#Manchester, John H, 240698" title="Manchester, John H, 240698" id="pers520">Corporal
            J. Manchester</a>
         in command of the Lewis gun team, ordered two men to cover him with its fire,
         while he and the remainder of the team rushed the post with the bayonet; four of
         the enemy were bayoneted, <a href="people-index.html#Manchester, John H, 240698" title="Manchester, John H, 240698" id="pers521">
            Corporal
            Manchester
            </a> himself killing the officer in charge, and the remainder of the
         enemy garrison between 20 and 30 fled, leaving the machine gun in our hands. The
         platoon then pushed forward, capturing four prisoners and clearing snipers out
         of the houses in Rue du Bois. The capture of this strong point enabled the whole
         line to advance, although there was some 
         [<a id="p172" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/172/mode/1up">p172</a>]
         
         resistance on the right flank from a machine gun, which was overcome and
         captured. At 11.50 p.m. news was received that the Division on our right had
         advanced, and occupied Indian Village, while the Battalion on our left had also
         moved forward, and occupied posts in advance of our left flank, so that our line
         could be pushed forward, and during the night the Battalion occupied its
         objective on Princes Road. <a href="people-index.html#Black, Adolphus George, 2nd Lt" title="Black, Adolphus George, 2nd Lt" id="pers522">

      <p>In accordance with orders our line was slightly withdrawn to the line Haystack
         Post-Path Post in order to form a good jumping off line for the 1/5th
         Leicestershire Regiment, who were to attack at dawn on the <span title="1918-09-04">4th</span>, their objective being the old British front
         line. The attack was a complete success, the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment
         passing through our line, and gaining their objective, and the 139th Brigade on
         our left and the 55th Division on our right were equally successful. As soon as
         the assaulting troops had passed through our line the Battalion, in
         accordance with Brigade orders, issued the previous evening, was reorganised,
         and followed the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment, acting as "moppers
         up" and keeping in close touch. The enemy resistance was slight and his
         artillery very little in evidence, and our casualties during the day were nil.
         During <span title="1918-09-04">September 4th</span> and <span title="1918-09-05">5th</span> we maintained our position, the enemy shelling the forward area
         with light, and the rear position with heavy, shells, but again we suffered no
         casualties.</p>
      
      <p>On the evening of <span title="1918-09-05">September 5th</span> the 138th Brigade
         was relieved by units of the 19th Division, the Battalion moving back at 8.30
         p.m. to the usual billets at <a id="place638" href="place-index.html?n=Verquin, France" title="Verquin, France">Verquin</a>,
         which we occupied till <span title="1918-09-11">September

         usual was devoted to cleaning and interior economy, being at the disposal of the
         Company Commanders for training. On the afternoon of the <span title="1918-09-11">11th</span> all preparations were completed for a movement by train, and
         during the night the move was carried out without any difficulty, our
         destination being <a id="place639" href="place-index.html?n=Ribemont-sur-Ancre, France" title="Ribemont-sur-Ancre, France">Ribemont</a> near
         <a id="place640" href="place-index.html?n=Amiens, France" title="Amiens, France">Amiens</a>. Although the village had
         suffered a good deal from shell fire, good billets, to our surprise and
         satisfaction, were available. The weather which had been fine for the last
         fortnight now broke, and the next few days were wet or showery. Companies were
         at the disposal of Company Commanders in the morning, and in the afternoons
         inter-platoon football and tug-of-war competitions were held, the finals being
         on <span title="1918-09-17">September 17th</span>, when No. 16 won the football,
         and No. 7 the tug-of-war. On two days the attack with ball ammunition was
         practised by platoons, in conjunction with Stokes trench mortars.</p>
      
      <p>This short rest ended on <span title="1918-09-19">September 19th</span>, when the
         Battalion left <a id="place641" href="place-index.html?n=Ribemont-sur-Ancre, France" title="Ribemont-sur-Ancre, France">Ribemont</a> by 'bus shortly
         before midnight, and arrived at <a id="place642" href="place-index.html?n=Tertry, France" title="Tertry, France">Tertry</a>,
         ten miles west of <a id="place643" href="place-index.html?n=Saint-Quentin, France" title="Saint-Quentin, France">St. Quintin</a>, at 6.15
         a.m. on the <span title="1918-09-20">20th</span>. The 46th Division was being
         concentrated in the area, preparatory to the attack on the Hindenburg Line,
         which took place on <span title="1918-09-29">September 29th</span>. This
         operation was a magnificent success, and was recognised to be one of the most
         brilliant feats of arms performed during the war. It is only possible in this
         history to record the part played by the Battalion, but the story of the
         Division as a whole, with a complete account of the battle, has been graphically
         described in <a href="people-index.html#Priestley, Raymond Edward, Maj" title="Priestley, Raymond Edward, Maj" id="pers524">

         Division).</p>
