      <h2>Trenches During The Summer and Autumn of 1917</h2>
      
      <p>The Battalion preparatory to a period of three weeks rest and training spent
         <span title="1917-07-04">July 4th</span> in refitting and reorganizing
         companies, and then carried out the programme laid down, which included
         ceremonial drill and musketry. On the <span title="1917-07-17">17th</span> the
         Brigade was inspected by the <a href="people-index.html#Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" title="Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" id="pers897">Divisional Commander</a>, and after the inspection was
         addressed by <a href="people-index.html#Horne, Henry Sinclair, Gen" title="Horne, Henry Sinclair, Gen" id="pers385">
            General
            Horne</a>, the Commander of the First Army. A draft of 96 men joined the
         Battalion the same day and platoons were re-organized incorporating the new
         draft. On the <span title="1917-07-19">19th</span> and <span title="1917-07-20">20th</span>, the Divisional Rifle Meeting was held, and the Battalion took
         1st place in the running man team shoot, second in the officers' team shoot,
         third in the Lewis gun team competition, and first in the running man
         individual. On <span title="1917-07-21">July 21st</span>, while the <a href="people-index.html#Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" title="Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" id="pers898">

         over on the <span title="1917-07-22">following day</span>, the Battalion marched
         to <a id="place515" href="place-index.html?n=Verquin, France" title="Verquin, France">Verquin</a> and billeted for the night,
         leaving next morning for <a id="place516" href="place-index.html?n=Mazingarbe, France" title="Mazingarbe, France">Mazingarbe</a>,
         where we rested for the afternoon, and in the evening relieved the 8th Bedfords
         (16th Brigade, 6th Division) in the line in the <a id="place517" href="place-index.html?n=Hulluch, France" title="Hulluch, France">Hulluch</a> sector, B and C Companies being in the front line, and
         A and D in reserve. The sector was fairly quiet, but a smoke barrage was put out
         from our trenches on the evening of the <span title="1917-07-23">23rd</span> to
         assist a raid made by the 1st Leicestershire Regiment on our left, and this was
         followed by increased artillery

         on the <span title="1917-07-26">26th</span>. The weather was very wet, the
         trenches flooded, and much repair work was necessary. We were relieved by the
         1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment on the <span title="1917-07-28">28th</span>, and

            Elie</a> Right Sub-Sector, three Companies being in the line, and one in
         reserve. All the front line Companies were in tunnels, with posts at the tunnel
         exits, the reserve Company occupying a trench immediately in the rear of the
         tunnel entrances. The tour was a quiet one generally, but occasionally enemy
         trench mortars were troublesome, <a href="people-index.html#Thomson, Wilfred Albert, 2nd Lt (d 1917)" title="Thomson, Wilfred Albert, 2nd Lt (d 1917)" id="pers396">

         evening of the <span title="1917-08-20">20th</span>, however, the Mansion House
         Dump at <a id="place525" href="place-index.html?n=Vermelles, France" title="Vermelles, France">Vermelles</a>, where rations were
         transferred to small trucks which were man-handled up to the front line, was
         heavily shelled, the metals being torn up in many places, and the ration train
         was only able to reach a point half a mile from the Dump. <a href="people-index.html#Rushton, Ernest William, 240039" title="Rushton, Ernest William, 240039" id="pers397">

         Brigadier gave instructions that their conduct on this occasion was to be
         considered an act worthy to be entered on their conduct sheets and in the
         Regimental records.</p>
      
      <p>On the <span title="1917-08-22">22nd</span> we were relieved by the 1/4th
         Lincolnshire Regiment and moved to billets in <a id="place526" href="place-index.html?n=Noyelles-les-Vermelles, France" title="Noyelles-les-Vermelles, France">Noyelles</a>, where we remained till the <span title="1917-08-28">28th</span>, when we began another tour in the trenches, which passed
         without incident, enemy trench mortar acitivity causing no casualties on this
         occasion. On <span title="1917-09-03">September 3rd</span> we were relieved from
         the front line, and the Battalion disposed with A and D Companies as forward
         support

         Philosophe. A raid was arranged to be carried out by the Battalion on the <span title="1917-09-08">8th</span>, and the companies selected (B and C) were
         carefully practised over a taped course at Philosophe during the next few days.</p>
      
      <p>At 4.15 p.m., the raiding party completed their fitting out and left <a id="place528" href="place-index.html?n=Noyelles-les-Vermelles, France" title="Noyelles-les-Vermelles, France">Noyelles</a> for the trenches, Zero hour being
         fixed for 7.55 p.m. The party consisted of <a href="people-index.html#Disney, Sydney Cecil William, Maj" title="Disney, Sydney Cecil William, Maj" id="pers402">Captain

         left rear party, and 100 Other Ranks. The assembly in Boyeau 78 was carried out without
         a hitch, and
         was evidently not noticed by the enemy as not a shot was fired. The barrage
         started punctually, and the men started off well, the advance being made in
         three lines at 30 yards distance, the objective being the enemy's third line.
         The German wire had been fairly well cut, but the enemy had made efforts to mend
         it with barbed concertina wire in places, and the men had to bunch to get
         through. However, it was passed everywhere without much difficulty, and there
         were no casualties previous to entering the front line trench. The enemy barrage
         came down quickly in No Man's Land behind the raiding party at Zero plus two
         minutes, and later increased in intensity—the preliminary wire cutting had
         probably put the enemy on his guard, and he was expecting an attack, as the
         first two lines of trenches were found unoccupied, but the third line was
         strongly held, and heavy rifle and machine gun fire was opened on the raiding
         party. An attempt was made to advance on this trench under cover of rifle and
         Lewis gun fire, but it was found to be strongly wired, 
         [<a id="p141" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/141/mode/1up">p141</a>]
          and some of our own shells were falling short, so the party
         withdrew our casualties being two killed, 16 wounded, and 3 missing. <a href="people-index.html#Disney, Sydney Cecil William, Maj" title="Disney, Sydney Cecil William, Maj" id="pers407">

         ability, remaining in the enemy trench until all the wounded had been evacuated,
         and being the last to leave. Several <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officers">N.C.O.'s</abbr> showed conspicuous courage and ability for leadership during the raid.

         enemy third line; he at once attacked the barricade with bombs until his supply
         was exhausted, and then did valuable work in organizing parties and directing
         their fire, showing no regard for his personal safety. <a href="people-index.html#Lewin, Herbert, 240571" title="Lewin, Herbert, 240571" id="pers409">Sergeant

         enemy did not retaliate in any way, and we were relieved at night by the 1/4th
         Lincolnshire Regiment, B and C Companies remaining as forward support in
         <a id="place533" href="place-index.html?n=Noyelles-les-Vermelles, France" title="Noyelles-les-Vermelles, France">Noyelles</a>, while A and D and
         Battalion Headquarters occupied billets in Philosophe.</p>
      
      <p>After the usual first day's rest working parties were supplied daily while out of
         the trenches, bathing and medical inspections were carried out, and the
         Battalion beat the 468th Company <abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr> by two goals to one in the first round of the Divisional Football
         League. On <span title="1917-10-03">October 3rd</span> we relieved the 1/4th
         Lincolnshire Regiment in the same trench sector, A, B, and D Companies in the
         line, with C Company in support. The following night gas was projected on to the
         enemy front from our line, but there was little retaliation. On the night of
         <span title="1917-10-05">October 5th</span>, which was cold and wet, the
         enemy made a silent raid on K Dump, garrisoned by A Company. Heavy rain clouds
         made the night darker than usual, and enabled the raiders to crawl along the
         disused trenches in front of K Dump to within 20 yards of the centre post before
         they were observed about 7 p.m. At the moment that they were first seen they
         threw bombs into all three posts, causing momentary confusion, then made a rush
         for the parapet of the trench, fired in to it, and immediately 
         [<a id="p143" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/143/mode/1up">p143</a>]
          retired. The whole affair only lasted half a
         minute and fire was at once opened on them as they ran back. After they retired
         <a href="people-index.html#Rose, 2nd Lt" title="Rose, 2nd Lt" id="pers414">
            2nd Lieut.
            Rose
            </a> was found to be missing; he had just visited the right post, and was
         walking to the centre post, when the raid took place. Patrols were at once sent
         out, and remained out during the night, but no trace of the missing officer was
         found. On the evening of the <span title="1917-10-07">7th</span> K Dump was
         heavily trench mortared; at 10 p.m. gas was projected from our front, and again
         very little retaliation by the enemy artillery occurred. On the evening of the
         <span title="1917-10-09">9th</span>, we were relieved by the 1/4th
         Lincolnshire Regiment, and went into Divisional Reserve at <a id="place534" href="place-index.html?n=Fouquieres-les-Bethune, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Fouquieres-les-Bethune, Pas-de-Calais, France">Fouquieres</a>, halting at <a id="place535" href="place-index.html?n=Noyelles-les-Vermelles, France" title="Noyelles-les-Vermelles, France">Noyelles</a> for a meal on route.</p>
