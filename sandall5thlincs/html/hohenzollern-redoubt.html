      <h2>The Hohenzollern Redoubt</h2>
      
      <p>Leaving 
         <a id="place183" href="place-index.html?n=Hesdigneul-les-Bethune, France" title="Hesdigneul-les-Bethune, France">Hesdigneul</a>
          at 4.30 p.m. on <span title="1915-10-12">October 12th</span>, we marched
         through <a id="place184" href="place-index.html?n=Bethune, France" title="Bethune, France">Bethune</a> and <a id="place185" href="place-index.html?n=Sailly, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Sailly, Pas-de-Calais, France">Sailly</a>-<a id="place735" href="place-index.html?n=Labourse, France" title="Labourse, France">la-Bourse</a> to a field beyond the latter,
         where we rested till dusk, and then resumed the march to <a id="place186" href="place-index.html?n=Vermelles, France" title="Vermelles, France">Vermelles</a>, where we were met by the guides
         detailed to lead us to the trenches in which we were to relieve the Irish
         Guards. At <a id="place187" href="place-index.html?n=Vermelles, France" title="Vermelles, France">Vermelles</a> each Company
         halted and were served out with the tools and bombs to be carried in the attack
         <span title="1915-10-13">next day</span>. The bombs were served out packed in
         sandbags under superintendence of the Divisional Bomb Officer, and were
         naturally accepted by the Company Commanders as serviceable stores, but on
         arrival in trenches, when distributed to the men, much of the load carried from
         <a id="place188" href="place-index.html?n=Vermelles, France" title="Vermelles, France">Vermelles</a> proved utterly useless
         consisting of rifle grenades without rods, and old bombs of all patterns, and
         the result was a shortage of bombs after the attack at a time of urgent need,
         which had most serious consequences. The night was very dark, the position of
         course entirely strange to the Battalion, and the guides appeared more uncertain
         of their way than usual, so that the relief was very slow, but was ultimately
         accomplished at 2 a.m. The disposition of the Battalion was four half Companies
         with Battalion Headquarters in the front line and four half Companies in the
         support line, 50 yards in rear. Excepting the necessary sentries all ranks were
         instructed to get as much rest as possible, but the order was more honoured in
         the 
         [<a id="p47" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/47/mode/1up">p47</a>]
          breach than in the observance,
         particularly by the Officers and <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officers">N.C.O.'s</abbr> who were hard at work practically the whole night. After stand-to at
         dawn on <span title="1915-10-13">October 13th</span>, the Battalion devoted
         itself to a good breakfast, and the morning was spent in organizing the details
         of the attack. At noon the preliminary bombardment began, probably the heaviest
         and most concentrated artillery attack by the British Army up to that date, as
         had been promised by the <a href="people-index.html#Haking, Richard Cyril Byrne, Lt-Gen" title="Haking, Richard Cyril Byrne, Lt-Gen" id="pers809">Corps Commander</a>; the enemy retaliation was not very
         severe, but a good many casualties were caused owing to the necessarily crowded
         condition of the trenches. The wind being favourable, gas cylinders having been
         previously installed in the front line, a gas cloud was discharged towards the
         enemy trenches at 1.45 p.m., but a certain number of casualties were sustained
         in our own front line, as the wind was gusty and occasionally drove back the
         cloud into portions of our own trenches. Zero hour was 2 p.m., when the
         Battalion left the trenches, and advanced "over the top" on
         the enemy position.</p>
      
      <p>It is not possible or desirable in a Battalion History to give the details of the
         whole operation, but it must be explained that the attack of the 46th Division
         on <span title="1915-10-13">October 13th, 1915</span>, was planned with two
         brigades in the front line, the 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade on the right and
         the 138th (Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade on the left with the 139th (Sherwood
         Foresters) Brigade in support. In the 138th Brigade two Battalions were in the
         front line, the 1/4th Leicestershire on the right, the 1/5th Lincolnshire on the
         left, with 1/4th Lincolnshire in support, and 1/5th Leicestershire in reserve.
         Each of the leading Battalions advanced in four waves, each Company moving in
         lines of platoons, the two leading platoons of each Company starting from the
         
         [<a id="p48" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/48/mode/1up">p48</a>]
          front line, and the two rear platoons from
         the support line. The distribution of the Companies in the Battalion was A, B,
         C, D from right to left, with Battalion Headquarters in the centre, and the
         first objective was the Fosse Trench in the German Line about 400
         yards behind the <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> face of the Hohenzollern Redoubt, which consisted of an oval work
         about 200 yards by 150, pushed forward from the Fosse Trench, and joined to it
         by several communication trenches; the Redoubt was situated on slightly rising
         ground, which dipped again behind towards the Fosse Trench, and was the only
         part of our objective actually visible from our own trenches.</p>
      
      <p>When the artillery lifted at 2 p.m.—it must be remembered that this was long
         before the idea of the "creeping barrage"—the infantry of the
         Division advanced most gallantly to the attack. The wire in front of the Redoubt
         was well cut, and the Battalion swept over the <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> and <abbr title="East">E.</abbr> faces with few casualties but on advancing over the open ground in
         front of the Fosse trench came under such heavy rifle and machine gun fire from
         the front and from both flanks, that the lines melted away, and further advance
         became impossible; although numerous isolated parties maintained themselves in
         shell holes at various points until dusk, the line as a whole was compelled to
         retire to the <abbr title="East">E</abbr> face of the Hohenzollern Redoubt, which was con-solidated for defence.
         The 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment on our right were in the same situation,
         exposed to very heavy frontal and enfilade rifle and machine gun fire, as the
         Brigade on our right was unable to advance owing to uncut wire, and the German
         position at Mad Point on our left was a nest of machine guns which our artillery
         were unable to silence. All ranks behaved most gallantly, but 
         [<a id="p49" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/49/mode/1up">p49</a>]
          the very heavy casualties in Officers and <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officers">N.C.O.'s</abbr> deprived the men of leadership, just at the time it was most needed,
         with the result that a certain amount of crowding took place, causing additional
         casualties. The Machine Gun Section under <a href="people-index.html#Madge, Reginald Ellige, Capt" title="Madge, Reginald Ellige, Capt" id="pers140">Captain
            R. E.
            Madge</a> took three guns forward with the
         Battalion, but two were quickly disabled, and only one came into action, the
         team under <a href="people-index.html#Drewry, Harry F, 1681" title="Drewry, Harry F, 1681" id="pers141">
            Sergeant
            Drewery
            </a> establishing themselves in an excellent position in a communication
         trench some distance beyond the <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> face of the Redoubt. Only two belt boxes reached the gun, but by
         collecting ammunition from casualties, it was kept in action until towards
         evening, when <a href="people-index.html#Drewry, Harry F, 1681" title="Drewry, Harry F, 1681" id="pers142">
            Sergeant
            Drewery</a>, finding his team completely isolated, retired down the trench to
         the <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> face of the Redoubt. For their gallantry on this occasion, <a href="people-index.html#Drewry, Harry F, 1681" title="Drewry, Harry F, 1681" id="pers143">
            Sergeant
            Drewery

            Private

      <p>As soon as the attack was definitely checked and the enemy realised that the
         Hohenzollern Redoubt was occupied and being consolidated by us with the
         assistance of the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment, who had advanced with us and the
         1st Monmouthshire Regiment, the Divisional Pioneer Battalion who came up for the
         purpose, a very heavy bombardment was directed on the <abbr title="East">E</abbr> face until the whole trench was practically obliterated, when the
         survivors retreated to the <abbr title="West">W</abbr> face, and held it through the night in spite of numerous enemy
         counter-attacks. At 8 a.m., in the morning of <span title="1915-10-14">October
            14th</span>, the Battalion, now reduced to a skeleton, under <a href="people-index.html#Madge, Reginald Ellige, Capt" title="Madge, Reginald Ellige, Capt" id="pers145">
            Captain
            Madge</a>, the only unwounded officer, was relieved, and withdrawn to the
         second line trenches, where they rested for the day, and in the evening withdrew
         still further to the Lancashire trenches in front of <a id="place189" href="place-index.html?n=Vermelles, France" title="Vermelles, France">Vermelles</a>.</p>
      
      [<a id="p50" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/50/mode/1up">p50</a>]
      
      
      <p>The casualties were extremely heavy; of 23 officers who went into action, 11 were
         killed and 11 wounded, of whom one subsequently died of wounds; 285 other ranks
         were reported killed or missing, and 175 wounded. Owing to the fact that the <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers810">Commanding
            Officer</a> was wounded, the <a href="people-index.html#Hoghton, Vere de, Capt (d 1915)" title="Hoghton, Vere de, Capt (d 1915)" id="pers811">Adjutant</a>, the <a href="people-index.html#Robinson, Harry Ingram, Maj (d 1915)" title="Robinson, Harry Ingram, Maj (d 1915)" id="pers812">2nd-in-Command</a>, and three Company
         Commanders killed, and the other Company Commander wounded, and every Officer,
         with the exception of the <a href="people-index.html#Madge, Reginald Ellige, Capt" title="Madge, Reginald Ellige, Capt" id="pers813">Machine Gun Officer</a>, became a casualty, it will be
         readily understood that great difficulty has been experienced in obtaining an
         accurate and reliable account of what actually happened. The most conspicuous of
         the <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officers">N.C.O.'s</abbr> who took command when their officers became casualties, was <a href="people-index.html#Leadbeater, Conrad, 240252 Capt" title="Leadbeater, Conrad, 240252 Capt" id="pers146">
            Corporal
            Leadbeater</a>, who took charge of a post in <abbr title="North">N.</abbr> Face, and when unable to advance further up the trench by bombing,
         built a barricade and consolidated the trench. During the night of the <span title="1915-10-13">13th</span>, he held the post by bombing, and the <span title="1915-10-14">following day</span> acted as a stretcher-bearer,
         regardless of personal danger. For his gallantry on this occasion he was awarded
         a bar to his <abbr title="Distinguished Conduct Medal">D.C.M.</abbr>, won in the <a id="place190" href="place-index.html?n=Ieper, Belgium" title="Ieper, Belgium">Ypres</a> salient on
         <span title="1915-09-30">September 30th</span>. Another <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr> who showed great initiative and resource was <a href="people-index.html#Campbell, Arthur, 3170" title="Campbell, Arthur, 3170" id="pers147">
            Sergeant
            Arthur
            Campbell</a>, who did excellent work in collecting and leading men who had become
         scattered; he was subsequently awarded the Military Medal.</p>
      
      <p>Of the many gallant deeds performed, and the numerous instances of courage,
         resource, and devotion to duty, few were ever recorded, owing to the very heavy
         casualties among the officers, and the consequent absence of official reports.
         The Military Medal was awarded to <a href="people-index.html#Hocknall, Charles A, 1573" title="Hocknall, Charles A, 1573" id="pers148">Private
            C. A.

      <p>On the evening of <span title="1915-10-15">October 15th</span>, the remnant of the
         Battalion under <a href="people-index.html#Madge, Reginald Ellige, Capt" title="Madge, Reginald Ellige, Capt" id="pers155">
            Captain
            Madge</a>, left the trenches, where they had rested for 24 hours, and
         proceeded to <a id="place191" href="place-index.html?n=Vermelles, France" title="Vermelles, France">Vermelles</a>, whence they
         were conveyed by 'bus back to their old billets at <a id="place192" href="place-index.html?n=Hesdigneul-les-Bethune, France" title="Hesdigneul-les-Bethune, France">Hesdigneul</a>.</p>
      
      <p>The attack on the Hohenzollern Redoubt was a feat of arms of which the Battalion
         will be ever proud, but the enormous number of casualties 
         [<a id="p52" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/52/mode/1up">p52</a>]
          practically destroyed it for the time being as a fighting
         unit. The survivors for a short period were shaken and depressed and all
         organization was destroyed, but the task of rebuilding the Battalion on its old
         lines and traditions was begun at once, and carried through ultimately with
         entire success.</p>
      
      <p>The loss in officers however was irreparable, as the following casualty list
         shows: it bears eloquent testimony to the gallant leading of the Battalion in
         attack. Killed in action: <a href="people-index.html#Robinson, Harry Ingram, Maj (d 1915)" title="Robinson, Harry Ingram, Maj (d 1915)" id="pers156">Major
