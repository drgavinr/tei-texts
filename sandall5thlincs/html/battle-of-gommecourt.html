      <h2>The Battle of Gommecourt</h2>
      
      <p>At daybreak on <span title="1916-07-01">July 1st, 1916</span>, the Battalion was
         resting in the Corps Line 1,000 yards East of <a id="place287" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a>, the 138th Brigade being the Reserve Brigade in the
         Divisional attack on <a id="place288" href="place-index.html?n=Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France">Gommecourt</a>, which
         was carried out by the 137th and 139th Brigades. In spite of a very gallant
         advance the attack was unsuccessful; the attacking waves who had entered the
         German trenches could not be supported owing to the very heavy German artillery
         barrage, and although they held out for many hours, they were gradually
         surrounded and overwhelmed.</p>
      
      <p>At 8.30 a.m., the Battalion advanced by platoons in artillery formation across
         the open ground between <a id="place289" href="place-index.html?n=Souastre, France" title="Souastre, France">Souastre</a> and
         <a id="place290" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a>, and reached the
         Midland trench in the rear of that village without casualties. The whole day was
         spent in this trench under a heavy bombardment during the afternoon, which
         caused some casualties, ten Other Ranks being killed and one wounded. We could
         obtain no information as to the success or otherwise of the operations, but as
         the day wore on, and no further orders to advance were received, it was realised
         that the attack must have failed. At length at 8.30 p.m., orders were received
         to send up two officers per Company to reconnoitre the enemy front line trenches
         in front of Gommecourt Wood, which had been unsuccessfully attacked by the 137th
         Brigade, and the situation, as far as it could be ascertained was explained by
         the Brigade Commander. It was supposed that 
         [<a id="p75" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/75/mode/1up">p75</a>]
         
         isolated parties of the 139th Brigade were still holding out in the enemy
         trenches, possibly in their front line, and orders were received that the
         Battalion would attack at 11 p.m., occupy and consolidate the German front line,
         getting into touch if possible with any parties of the Sherwood Foresters, who
         might be still holding out in the German trenches on the left of the frontage
         assigned for the Battalion attack, while on the right the 1/5th Battalion
         Leicestershire Regiment would dig a defensive flank connecting the German with
         our own front line. These orders were received at 9 p.m. but it was represented
         that as the Company Commanders had gone up to the front to reconnoitre according
         to previous orders, it would be impossible by 11 p.m. for them to organise their
         Companies for attack, as it would first be necessary to reach the front line,
         and relieve the 139th Brigade; accordingly the hour of attack was fixed for 12
         midnight, and an artillery barrage on the German second line arranged for that
         hour. At 9.30 p.m., the Battalion started to leave the Midland Trench, and
         proceed through <a id="place291" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a> up to the
         front line. The communication trenches were found badly battered by shell fire,
         with many dead bodies in them, and very congested by stragglers and wounded
         coming in from No Man's Land, and consequently progress was very slow, and it
         was 11 p.m. before the Company Commanders were met and received their orders
         from the <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers828"><abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> Battalion</a>. The whole Battalion was ordered to attack in four
         lines of platoons on a four company frontage, and as quickly as possible was
         drawn up in this formation in No Man's Land. At 11.30 p.m., the orders from
         Brigade were suddenly changed, and the Battalion was ordered not to consolidate
         the German front line trench when occupied, but to retire as soon as touch with
         the 
         [<a id="p76" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/76/mode/1up">p76</a>]
          parties of the Sherwood Foresters was
         obtained, and bring them back, and in any case to retire to our own lines before
         dawn; this change of orders did not reach the Company Commanders until the
         advance had begun. At 12 midnight on <span title="1916-07-01">July
            1st</span>-<span title="1916-07-02">2nd</span>, although only one Company was
         really ready, the first line of platoons went forward, but in the darkness lost
         touch and direction almost at once, and only two platoons reached the enemy
         wire, which was found uncut. The enemy trench was found to be strongly held, and
         very heavy rifle and machine gun fire was opened on the Battalion, while
         innumerable flares and Verey lights lit up the front line. Further advance was
         obviously impossible, and to avoid further useless casualties, the <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers829">
            <abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr>
            </a> ordered a halt, and every man was ordered to lie down, but no retirement
         was made. Meanwhile the situation was pointed out to the <a href="people-index.html#Kemp, Geoffrey Chicheley, Brig-Gen" title="Kemp, Geoffrey Chicheley, Brig-Gen" id="pers830">Brigade Commander</a> by telephone,
         explaining that the enemy front line was strongly held, that the wire was uncut,
         that it was obvious that no parties of Sherwoods were in the objective assigned
         to the Battalion, and that it was impossible to gain this objective. In spite of
         this the <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers831"><abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> Battalion</a> was informed that the <a href="people-index.html#Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" title="Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" id="pers832">Divisional
            Commander</a> insisted on another attempt being made as soon as the attack
         could be reorganised and accordingly a valiant attempt was made to regain
         direction and touch within the Battalion, preparatory to another advance. The
         night was intensely dark, and the task was very difficult, and before the
         Battalion was ready to advance again instructions were received by telephone
         from the <a href="people-index.html#Kemp, Geoffrey Chicheley, Brig-Gen" title="Kemp, Geoffrey Chicheley, Brig-Gen" id="pers833">Brigadier</a> that
         the <a href="people-index.html#Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" title="Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" id="pers834">Divisional Commander</a> had reconsidered the matter, and that no further
         attack would be made; the Battalion would withdraw to our old front line, and
         during the remaining hours of darkness endeavour to bring in all wounded in 
         [<a id="p77" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/77/mode/1up">p77</a>]
          No Man's Land, of whom there were many from
         the 137th and 138th Brigades. In accordance with these instructions the
         Battalion retired, having one officer, <a href="people-index.html#Walcott, Lyons George Edmund, Lt (d 1916)" title="Walcott, Lyons George Edmund, Lt (d 1916)" id="pers209">Lieut.
            G. F.
            Walcott</a>, killed and two, Lieuts. <a href="people-index.html#Lorenzen, Otto Hans Herman, 2nd Lt" title="Lorenzen, Otto Hans Herman, 2nd Lt" id="pers210">O. M. H. Lorenzon</a> (who subsequently died
         of wounds) and <a href="people-index.html#Pearson, George Joyce, Lt" title="Pearson, George Joyce, Lt" id="pers211">J. J.
            Pearson</a>, wounded, with forty-five other
         casualties. The conduct of all ranks was excellent, and the officers did their
         best in most adverse circumstances, but the task allotted to the Battalion was
         really hopeless from the beginning. To expect a single Battalion in a night
         attack to capture an enemy trench with uncut wire, which a Brigade had failed to
         take earlier in the day, with the enemy very much on the alert in consequence,
         is at the best a forlorn hope; when it is realised that the time to organize the
         attack was far too short, that owing to darkness, blocking of trenches, and the
         confusion produced by numerous stragglers and wounded from other units,
         communication of orders and preliminary organisation for the assembly before the
         advance were very difficult, it is obvious that failure was inevitable, and that
         no discredit is reflected on the Battalion. On the contrary the fact that, when
         the first attack was held up, no retirement was made but the Battalion lay out
         in No Man's Land under heavy rifle and machine gun fire, and maintained its
         position until the <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers835">
            <abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr>
            </a> ordered the retirement when this had been sanctioned by the Divisional
         Commander, is a striking testimony to the high standard of discipline; and the
         re-organization for a second attack in the same circumstances in intense
         darkness reflects very great credit on the Company Officers and all ranks as
         well.</p>
      
      <p>No attempt has been made to describe the operations of other Units or the
         Division as a whole, but the foregoing account represents simply the actual 
         [<a id="p78" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/78/mode/1up">p78</a>]
          part played by the Battalion on the night of
         <span title="1916-07-01">July 1st</span>-<span title="1916-07-02">2nd</span>.
         The following Complimentary Order was issued from VII. Corps:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
         
         <p>The <a href="people-index.html#Snow, Thomas D'Oyly, Lt-Gen" title="Snow, Thomas D'Oyly, Lt-Gen" id="pers836">Corps
               Commander</a> wishes to congratulate the troops of the 46th Division
            for the manner in which they fought and endured during the fighting on <span title="1916-07-01">July 1st</span>. Many gallant acts both by units and
            individuals are to hand.</p>
         
         <p>Although <a id="place292" href="place-index.html?n=Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France">Gommecourt</a> has not fallen
            into our hands the purpose of the attack, which was mainly to contain and
            kill Germans, was accomplished.</p>
         </blockquote>
      
      <p>The following order was issued by the 46th Division:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
         
         <p>The <a href="people-index.html#Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" title="Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" id="pers837">Major-General Commanding</a> wishes all ranks to thoroughly understand
            that our recent attack on the <a id="place293" href="place-index.html?n=Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France">Gommecourt</a> salient in concert with the 56th Division embraced
            two purposes,</p>
         
         <p>(a) The capture of the position; (b) The retaining of considerable numbers of
            German troops in our immediate front in order to prevent them taking part in
            resisting the advance of our troops in the South. Although the first purpose
            was not achieved, the second was fulfilled and there is no doubt that our
            action on <span title="1916-07-01">July 1st</span> materially assisted our
            troops in the Fourth Army and contributed to their successes.</p>
         </blockquote>
      
      <p>As soon as the retirement to our trenches had been effected, and trench garrisons
         organised, all available men were sent out to bring in wounded from No Man's
         Land, and 39 cases were rescued before dawn. Many gallant actions were performed
         during the night and the conspicuous gallantry of <a href="people-index.html#Coppin, Arthur, 240098" title="Coppin, Arthur, 240098" id="pers212">Sergeant
            A. Coppin</a>
         must be recorded, for which he was awarded the Military Medal. After the first
         attack on the German lines he returned carrying a wounded man on his back. He
         asked permission to go out and 
         [<a id="p79" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/79/mode/1up">p79</a>]
          bring in
         another wounded man whom he knew to be lying but within 40 yards of the German
         wire, and succeeded in doing so. He went out a third time to search for other
         wounded of his Company, working the whole time alone in the darkness and under
         heavy fire.</p>
      
      <p>About 4 a.m. after it was light on <span title="1916-07-02">July 2nd</span>, a
         body lying about 60 yards in front of our wire was noticed to move, and
         <a href="people-index.html#Welby, Ignatius, Capt" title="Welby, Ignatius, Capt" id="pers213">Lieut.
            I. Welby</a> went
         out to investigate and found a private of 1/7th Sherwood Foresters wounded in
         the head and just recovering consciousness. He returned and called for
         volunteers to help with a stretcher, but they were heavily sniped, and compelled
         to lie down until the position of the sniper was located, and a Lewis Gun from
         our trenches directed on the spot, and under cover of its fire the wounded man
         was brought in at 4.45 a.m. <a href="people-index.html#Welby, Ignatius, Capt" title="Welby, Ignatius, Capt" id="pers214">
            Lieut.
            Welby

            Private
            Austin</a>, who assisted him, the Military Medal.</p>
      
      <p>The day passed quietly, and several wounded men succeeded in crawling back from
         No Man's Land into our trenches. Battalion Headquarters which had been situated
         in the Support Line, were moved back to <a id="place294" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a> village, and the usual routine of trenches was
         resumed. About 4 p.m., <a href="people-index.html#Willerton, Samuel W, 1959" title="Willerton, Samuel W, 1959" id="pers217">Sergeant
            S. Willerton</a>
         showed conspicuous gallantry, for which he was subsequently awarded the Military
         Medal, when he went out about 100 yards in front of our trenches to take some
         water to a wounded <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr> of the Sherwood Foresters who was lying in the open. He placed the
         wounded man in a shell hole, and stayed with him till 10.50 p.m., when under
         cover of darkness he assisted to bring him in. During the next night 5 wounded
         and 21 bodies were recovered by search parties in No Man's Land in front of our
         line, and also four Lewis Guns. <a href="people-index.html#Goodchild, Thomas George, 240428" title="Goodchild, Thomas George, 240428" id="pers218">Sergeant
            T. G.
            Goodchild</a>
         [<a id="p80" href="images/https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/80/mode/1up">p80</a>]  showed great courage, going out
         close to the German wire, and spending considerable time under fire in a
         determined but unsuccessful search for the body of his Platoon Officer,
         <a href="people-index.html#Walcott, Lyons George Edmund, Lt (d 1916)" title="Walcott, Lyons George Edmund, Lt (d 1916)" id="pers219">
            Lieut.
            Walcott</a>, who had been killed the night before. This <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr> subsequently exhibited conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty on
         several occasions, and was awarded the <abbr title="Distinguished Conduct Medal">D.C.M.</abbr></p>
      
      <p>The next day, <span title="1916-07-03">July 3rd</span>, was again very quiet on
         our sector, and was spent in clearing and repairing trenches, and about 7.30
         p.m. the 1/4th Battalion Royal Fusiliers began to arrive to relieve us, and
         relief was completed by 11 p.m. The Battalion proceeded to <a id="place295" href="place-index.html?n=Foncquevillers, France" title="Foncquevillers, France">Fonquevillers</a>, but instead of returning to
         billets, was directed to relieve the 11th Royal Warwickshire Regiment in a
         sector of trenches immediately North of those previously occupied, our right
         resting on the <a id="place296" href="place-index.html?n=La Brayelle, Bucquoy, France" title="La Brayelle, Bucquoy, France">La Brayelle</a> road, the
         relief being completed by 4 a.m. on the <span title="1916-07-04">4th</span>. The
         trenches in this sector were more than 1,000 yards from the enemy lines, with
         the exception of two advanced lines of trenches 150 and 300 yards respectively
         in front of the original front line, which were in an unfinished state, and
         devoid of shelter, and were therefore not occupied by day and only patrolled at
         night to prevent the enemy taking advantage of them. Three Companies were
         distributed in the front line, with one Company in support at Battalion
         Headquarters in dug-outs near the cross roads in front of <a id="place297" href="place-index.html?n=Hannescamps, France" title="Hannescamps, France">Hannescamps</a> village.</p>
      
      <p>The weather now suddenly changed; the last week had been gloriously fine with
         brilliant sunshine, but heavy rain fell during the next few days at intervals,
         and the trenches became flooded, the advanced trenches were 4 feet deep in
         water, and the communication trenches in places were waist deep. At the same
         time the weather was very warm, 
         [<a id="p81" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/81/mode/1up">p81</a>]
          and although
         there was much discomfort, there was little real hardship, and the carrying
         parties to the front line became a source of much amusement, and the subject of
         much friendly chaff in the matter of their dress, as trousers were abandoned,
         their clothing consisting of shirts, jackets, boots, supplemented in the case of
         the more modest spirits by home-made bathing drawers made from sandbags. The
         sector was a very quiet one, and with the exception of rather heavy shelling of
         the dug-outs of the Support Company, and Battalion Headquarters, from 11 a.m. to
         12 noon on <span title="1916-07-05">July 5th</span>, no special incident occurred
         until the <span title="1916-07-09">9th</span>, when the right Company were
         relieved by the Queen's Westminsters at 9 a.m. No warning of this proposed
         relief had been given by the Brigade, and as a consequence the Queen's
         Westminster Officers, who had arrived early in the morning, stating that they
         wished to reconnoitre the trenches before taking over, were promptly put under
         arrest by the <abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> Company and were only released when telephonic communication
         with Brigade established the fact that the relief was quite in order, although
         the Division had entirely forgotten to inform the Brigade, and consequently
         ourselves, that it had been arranged. On the <span title="1916-07-10">10th</span>, the <a href="people-index.html#Johnston, R H, Lt-Col" title="Johnston, R H, Lt-Col" id="pers839"><abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> 8th Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment</a> visited the sector, as it
         was arranged that our two right Companies in the line should be relieved by the
         8th Lincolns <span title="1916-07-11">next day</span>, while the left Company
