      <h2>Preface</h2>
      
      <p>The following pages have been written at the suggestion of <a href="people-index.html#Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" title="Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" id="pers1">Lieut.-Col.
            H. G.
            Wilson</a>, <abbr title="Distinguished Service Order">D.S.O.</abbr>, the present Commanding Officer of the Battalion, who has given me
         most valuable assistance, both in furnishing me with all the material and
         information at his disposal, and in very kindly arranging for the publication of
         the volume.</p>
      
      <p>No attempt has been made, except in so far as is necessary to render the
         narrative intelligible, to describe the military operations in which the
         Battalion took part, as it appears outside the scope of a simple Battalion
         record to deal adequately with tactical situations, which would necessarily
         involve the consideration of the actions of other units and higher formations.</p>
      
      <p>Some errors in a record such as this, compiled from many different sources, are
         almost inevitable, and for these I must plead forgiveness as well as for many
         omissions, which those who know the story of the Battalion will no doubt detect.
         It must be remembered, however, that in the stress of active service much good
         work by individuals passes unnoticed, many gallant actions are performed that
         are never placed on record, and I can only hope that, in spite of its numerous
         defects, what I have written may be deemed an adequate record and worthy of the
         Battalion, to which all who served with it were proud to belong.</p>
      
      <p>I desire to tender my sincere thanks to all those who have placed materials at my
         disposal on which a narrative could be based, especially <a href="people-index.html#Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" title="Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" id="pers2">Lieut.-Col.
