      <h2>Early Days in France</h2>
      
      <p>At 11 p.m. on <span title="1915-02-26">Friday, February 26th, 1915</span>, the
         Battalion paraded for the last time in England, and marched to <a id="place80" href="place-index.html?n=Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, England" title="Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, England">Bishop's Stortford</a> station where they entrained
         for <a id="place81" href="place-index.html?n=Southampton, Hampshire, England" title="Southampton, Hampshire, England">Southampton</a> on their way to the
         Front. The departure from <a id="place82" href="place-index.html?n=Stansted, Essex, England" title="Stansted, Essex, England">Stansted</a> of
         the Battalion headed by the band, which had been selected to accompany the
         Lincoln and Leicester Brigade as the Brigade band, was witnessed, despite the
         late hour, by large numbers of the inhabitants, and was a scene of great
         enthusiasm. All ranks were in the highest spirits, confident in themselves,
         eager to prove themselves in the Field, proud to belong to the first Territorial
         Division to proceed as such, to France. The three miles march to <a id="place83" href="place-index.html?n=Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, England" title="Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, England">Bishop's Stortford</a> completed, the Battalion
         entrained without a hitch, arriving at <a id="place84" href="place-index.html?n=Southampton, Hampshire, England" title="Southampton, Hampshire, England">Southampton</a> Docks at 7 a.m. on <span title="1915-02-27">February
            27th</span>. The Transport and 200 men proceeded to a Rest Camp, while the
         remainder waited in the Docks till 3 p.m., when they embarked on the S.S.
         Empress Queen, with various other details, and left the Harbour at 10
         p.m. for <a id="place85" href="place-index.html?n=Le Havre, France" title="Le Havre, France">Havre</a>. The passage was
         uneventful and fairly smooth and was completed at 4 a.m. on the <span title="1915-02-28">28th</span>, but many of the men had never been at sea
         before and a considerable number fell victims to sea-sickness. At 8 a.m.
         disembarkation began, under the superintendence of <a href="people-index.html#Sleight, Ernest, Maj" title="Sleight, Ernest, Maj" id="pers85">Major
            E. Sleight</a>,
         who had proceeded to <a id="place86" href="place-index.html?n=Le Havre, France" title="Le Havre, France">Havre</a> some days
         previously to act as Assistant Military Landing Officer to the Division. A march
         of four 
         [<a id="p20" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/20/mode/1up">p20</a>]
          miles to the Rest Camp, on the heights
         between <a id="place87" href="place-index.html?n=Le Havre, France" title="Le Havre, France">Havre</a> and <a id="place88" href="place-index.html?n=Le Havre, France" title="Le Havre, France">Harfleur</a>, overlooking the estuary of the Seine
         followed, and the Battalion found themselves under canvas for the first time
         since mobilization. The contrast between tents on the wind-swept heights of
         Normandy in bitterly cold weather in February and the training camp under a hot
         July sun on the Yorkshire coast at <a id="place89" href="place-index.html?n=Bridlington, Yorkshire, England" title="Bridlington, Yorkshire, England">Bridlington</a> can better be imagined than described. Under these
         conditions the Battalion proceeded to make themselves as comfortable as
         circumstances permitted to await the arrival of the Transport and the detachment
         left at <a id="place90" href="place-index.html?n=Southampton, Hampshire, England" title="Southampton, Hampshire, England">Southampton</a>, and for several
         days they waited in vain. A route march of six miles was undertaken daily to
         keep the men fit and a certain amount of instruction given by means of lectures;
         goat-skin trench-coats were issued to the great delight of the recipients, the
         more welcome as the ground was covered with snow, which remained, where not
         churned up into mud, until our departure. On <span title="1915-03-02">March
            2nd</span> two Platoons were detailed as an advanced-party and left by train for
         their destination, and at length on the <span title="1915-03-04">4th</span> the
         anxiously-awaited Transport arrived, and the Battalion left the Rest Camp at 9
         p.m. to join them at the Gare de Merchandise at <a id="place91" href="place-index.html?n=Le Havre, France" title="Le Havre, France">Havre</a>. The first entrainment with French rolling stock was
         rather a slow performance, owing to inexperience, but was completed in good time
         for the departure of the train at 2.15 a.m. on <span title="1915-03-05">March
            5th</span>. The long railway journey at the pace of a French train in war time
         was a novel experience. <a id="place92" href="place-index.html?n=Monterolier, France" title="Monterolier, France">Monterolier-Buchy</a>, where boiling water was ready to make tea, was
         reached at 7 a.m. and <a id="place93" href="place-index.html?n=Abbeville, Somme, Picardie, France" title="Abbeville, Somme, Picardie, France">Abbeville</a> at 2.30
         p.m. with many wayside halts, passing <a id="place94" href="place-index.html?n=Boulogne-sur-Mer, France" title="Boulogne-sur-Mer, France">Boulogne</a> and <a id="place95" href="place-index.html?n=Calais, France" title="Calais, France">Calais</a>:
         <a id="place96" href="place-index.html?n=Saint-Omer, France" title="Saint-Omer, France">St. Omer</a>, then the Headquarters of
         the British Army, was reached at 8.30 p.m. and our final destination, <a id="place97" href="place-index.html?n=Arneke, France" title="Arneke, France">Arneke</a>, 
         [<a id="p21" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/21/mode/1up">p21</a>]
          near
         <a id="place98" href="place-index.html?n=Hazebrouck, Nord, France" title="Hazebrouck, Nord, France">Haazebrouk</a>, which had only been
         notified at <a id="place99" href="place-index.html?n=Saint-Omer, France" title="Saint-Omer, France">St. Omer</a>, at 11 p.m. The
         Battalion was to experience many such journeys in the future, but this first
         slow progress towards the Front in the unfamiliar French
         "wagons", each carrying 40 men, made an indelible impression
         on the minds of those who made it.</p>
      
      <p>The Battalion detrained most satisfactorily by the unaccustomed light of flares,
         found temporary billets near the station for the night, and marched at 9 a.m.
         next morning to <a id="place100" href="place-index.html?n=Zermezeele, France" title="Zermezeele, France">Zermazeele</a> and
         <a id="place101" href="place-index.html?n=Wemaers-Cappel, France" title="Wemaers-Cappel, France">Weimar's Cappel</a>, where they
         remained in scattered billets for the next three days, the time being occupied
         in Platoon training, while the Signal Section distinguished themselves by their
         first effort at communication in the Field, running up temporary but efficient
         telephone communication between Battalion Headquarters at <a id="place102" href="place-index.html?n=Wemaers-Cappel, France" title="Wemaers-Cappel, France">Weimar's Cappel</a> Chateau and the various
         Company Headquarters in the villages. The other Battalions of the Lincoln and
         Leicester Brigade were billeted in the neighbouring villages, and on <span title="1915-03-09">March 9th</span> the Brigade concentrated, and marched
         through <a id="place103" href="place-index.html?n=Cassel, France" title="Cassel, France">Cassel</a>, passing the
         Headquarters of the French Army under <a href="people-index.html#Foch, Ferdinand, Marshal" title="Foch, Ferdinand, Marshal" id="pers86">
            General
            Foch</a>, the band playing and the usual compliments being paid; then on
         through <a id="place104" href="place-index.html?n=Caestre, France" title="Caestre, France">Caestre</a>, where they were
         inspected on the march by <a href="people-index.html#Smith-Dorrien, Horace Lockwood, Gen" title="Smith-Dorrien, Horace Lockwood, Gen" id="pers87">
            General
            Smith-Dorien</a>, under whose command the North Midland Division was then placed, to
         <a id="place105" href="place-index.html?n=Strazeele, France" title="Strazeele, France">Strazeele</a> near <a id="place106" href="place-index.html?n=Bailleul, France" title="Bailleul, France">Bailleul</a>, where good billets were found.</p>
      
      <p>At <a id="place107" href="place-index.html?n=Strazeele, France" title="Strazeele, France">Strazeele</a>, the Battalion remained for
         two days, under orders to be ready to march at short notice. Excitement ran high
         as the Division was known to be detailed as Army Reserve during the Battle of
         <a id="place108" href="place-index.html?n=Neuve-Chapelle, France" title="Neuve-Chapelle, France">Neuve Chapelle</a>, from which so much
         was expected; visions presented themselves of the Battalion coming into action
         for the first time in "open warfare" 
         [<a id="p22" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/22/mode/1up">p22</a>]
          instead of in trenches, as a consequence of the hoped for
         break through in the German line. All ranks were directed to remain near their
         billets, but horses must be exercised, and by an evil chance the orders to move
         at 11.45 a.m. was received at 10.55 a.m., when all the Transport animals were
         out at exercise. As a consequence the fulfilment of the order was impossible and
         it was not until 1.40 p.m. that the Brigade was formed up to march to <a id="place109" href="place-index.html?n=Sailly-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Sailly-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais, France">Sailly-sur-Lys</a>, the displeasure of the <a href="people-index.html#Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" title="Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" id="pers796">Divisional
            Commander</a> at the delay descending with the added wrath of the <a href="people-index.html#Clifford, Walter Rees, Brig-Gen" title="Clifford, Walter Rees, Brig-Gen" id="pers797">Brigade
            Commander</a>, on the unfortunate <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers798">
            <abbr title="Commanding Officer">C.O.</abbr>
            </a> of the Battalion. The march, during which continuous heavy gun-fire was
         heard, was very trying and tedious, with many halts, and the Battalion at length
         arrived at <a id="place110" href="place-index.html?n=Sailly-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Sailly-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais, France">Sailly</a> at 8.45 p.m., the
         supply waggons not appearing till 10.30 p.m., to find very limited billeting
         accomodation, and the only shelter available for some 250 men was beneath the
         transport vehicles, which were parked in the streets.</p>
      
      <p>During <span title="1915-03-12">March 12th</span> and <span title="1915-03-13">13th</span>, the Battalion remained at <a id="place111" href="place-index.html?n=Sailly-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais, France" title="Sailly-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais, France">Sailly</a> under orders to be ready to move at a moment's notice,
         billets being gradually found for everyone, but the hope of coming into action,
         slowly faded as the days passed and on the <span title="1915-03-14">14th</span>
         and <span title="1915-03-15">15th</span> the orders were varied, viz., to be
         ready to move at two hours' notice, and a certain amount of Platoon training was
         carried out to occupy the time. At length it was realised, although a part of
         the Divisional Artillery came into action, that the Infantry would not have the
         opportunity of taking part in the battle of <a id="place112" href="place-index.html?n=Neuve-Chapelle, France" title="Neuve-Chapelle, France">Neuve-Chappelle</a>, and on the <span title="1915-03-16">
            16th</span>, the Brigade was ordered to move back, the Battalion retiring to very
         scattered and crowded billets near <a id="place113">Trou
            Bayard</a>, our right to occupy some of them causing a somewhat heated
         dispute, finally terminated in our favour, with some detachments 
         [<a id="p23" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/23/mode/1up">p23</a>]
          of the Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars, who
         had also arrived to billet in the same area. <span title="">After two days</span>, during
         which only Platoon training could be carried out, the Battalion moved to
         <a id="place114" href="place-index.html?n=Steenwerck, Nord, France" title="Steenwerck, Nord, France">Steenwercke</a>, about three miles
         south of <a id="place115" href="place-index.html?n=Bailleul, France" title="Bailleul, France">Bailleul</a>, and settled down
         into comfortable billets, and for the next week the time was occupied by route
         marches, Company training, Platoon training, instruction in trench construction,
         and the usual interior economy and routine of a Battalion behind the lines in
         the early days before the era of laundries and divisional baths. The billets at
         <a id="place116" href="place-index.html?n=Steenwerck, Nord, France" title="Steenwerck, Nord, France">Steenwercke</a> were more or less
         typical of those occupied in Northern France on many subsequent occasions; they
         have often been described but in order to appreciate the surroundings of the
         Battalion when not in the front line, it must be remembered that the men of a
         Company were usually billeted in the barns and out-buildings surrounding the
         farm house in which the Company Officers could find accommodation, the centre of
         the yard being invariably occupied by a gigantic manure heap, to the great
         discomfiture of the British Sanitary Service, who entirely failed, then and
         afterwards, to convince the inhabitants that this was detrimental to health,
         even though the sole water supply was obtained from a well in a corner within a
         few feet of the oderiferous mound. In the early days straw was usually easily
         obtained on payment and the Officers generally provided it for their men. For
         bathing large tubs could usually be borrowed; when these were not available a
         large hole was dug in a neighbouring field, lined with a tarpaulin sheet from a
         transport waggon and a very useful, if primitive, bath provided: hot water was
         obtained from the Battalion cookers. Clothes were washed as and when opportunity
         offered and dried on the grass or hedge rows. Battalion Headquarters were 
         [<a id="p24" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/24/mode/1up">p24</a>]
          generally in a similar farm or house in the
         village, while the Transport was parked and horses picketed on the nearest
         suitable ground.</p>
      
      <p>During the next fortnight, the Division was sent up to the Line in relays of
         Battalions for instruction in trench duties. The turn of the 5th Lincolnshire
         arrived on <span title="1915-03-26">March 26th</span>, when the Battalion moved
         to Oosthoove Farm, a large pile of buildings near <a id="place117" href="place-index.html?n=Ploegsteert, Comines, Belgium" title="Ploegsteert, Comines, Belgium">Ploegsteert</a>, known to the Army as Plug Street, which
         accommodated the whole Battalion while attached to the 11th Infantry Brigade,
         then holding the line in this sector. One Company proceeded to trenches each
         night for attachment to a Company of the 2nd East Lancashire Regiment who
         occupied a line on the edge of <a id="place118" href="place-index.html?n=Ploegsteert, Comines, Belgium" title="Ploegsteert, Comines, Belgium">Ploegsteert</a> Wood, being relieved by another Company after 24 hours'
         duty. During this preliminary tour, when much valuable experience was gained,
         the first casualties were suffered, one <abbr title="Non-Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr> being killed and three men wounded. On <span title="1915-03-31">March
            31st</span> the Battalion returned to their former billets at <a id="place119" href="place-index.html?n=Steenwerck, Nord, France" title="Steenwerck, Nord, France">Steenwercke</a>, where the next few days were
         spent, during which instruction was given in bombs and bomb-throwing, then a
         complete novelty. The conversion of the Machine Guns for Mark vii. ammunition
         had been found very defective during the tour in the <a id="place120" href="place-index.html?n=Ploegsteert, Comines, Belgium" title="Ploegsteert, Comines, Belgium">Ploegsteert</a> sector, and the necessary
         alterations and repairs to make the guns serviceable were carried out by the 
         <abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr>
         
         of a convenient Ordnance Depôt. It is interesting to record that the
         2nd Battalion of the Lincolnshire Regiment was at the same time billeted at
         <a id="place121">Bac St. Maur</a>, three miles away,
         when out of trenches, the <abbr title="Commanding Officer">C.O.</abbr> being <a href="people-index.html#Cox, S Fitzgerald, Lt-Col" title="Cox, S Fitzgerald, Lt-Col" id="pers88">Major
            S. F.
            Cox</a>, a former Adjutant of the 3rd
         Volunteer Battalion, so on the afternoon of <span title="1915-04-01">April
            1st</span> the band was sent over to play for the 2nd Battalion who heard to
         their great delight the strains of the Lincolnshire Poacher for the first time
         
         [<a id="p25" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/25/mode/1up">p25</a>]
          since their landing in France, bands for
         regular units not being sanctioned at this time.</p>
      
      <p>The time had now come for the North Midland Division to take its place in the
         line, and on <span title="1915-04-05">April 5th</span>, the Battalion left
         <a id="place122" href="place-index.html?n=Steenwerck, Nord, France" title="Steenwerck, Nord, France">Steenwercke</a> for <a id="place123" href="place-index.html?n=Bailleul, France" title="Bailleul, France">Bailleul</a>, where it billeted for the night,
         marching next morning to <a id="place124" href="place-index.html?n=Dranouter, Heuvelland, Belgium" title="Dranouter, Heuvelland, Belgium">Dranoutre</a> near
         <a id="place125" href="place-index.html?n=Kemmel, Heuvelland, Belgium" title="Kemmel, Heuvelland, Belgium">Kemmel</a>, where billets were occupied
         preparatory to taking over a line of trenches on the <span title="1915-04-08">8th</span>. During these three days the Officers were sent up to make
         themselves acquainted with the trenches to be held, and on the evening of <span title="1915-04-08">April 8th</span>, the Battalion relieved the
         4th Leicestershire Regiment who had taken over the trenches four days
         previously. The relief, owing to the inexperience of both Battalions, was a
         lengthy proceeding, and was not completed until nearly 3 a.m., when the
         Battalion realised the first of its ambitions and took its place as a
         responsible unit holding a sector of the line.</p>
      
      <p>The position held was an unfavourable one, facing the <a id="place126" href="place-index.html?n=Mesen, Belgium" title="Mesen, Belgium">Messines</a>-<a id="place127" href="place-index.html?n=Wijtschate, Heuvelland, Belgium" title="Wijtschate, Heuvelland, Belgium">Wychaete</a> Ridge, the German trenches being on higher ground, and to
         a great extent commanding a view over our own. The "trenches"
         here were really breastworks only, built of sandbags with very little depth of
         excavated trench—sometimes with none. The one communication trench was shallow,
         practically undrained, very wet and only used by day, as by night ration parties
         and reliefs preferred to move direct to the front line over the open to
         struggling along a communication trench knee-deep in mud and water. The first
         casualty to an officer occurred from this cause, when <a href="people-index.html#Hadfield, James Henry, Maj" title="Hadfield, James Henry, Maj" id="pers89">Captain
            J. H.
            Hadfield</a> was wounded seriously on <span title="1915-04-19">April 19th</span> by a stray bullet when leaving the
         trenches after relief. The trenches were an irregular line roughly 200 yards
         from the enemy's, but two trenches, E 1 Right and E 1 Left, were really isolated

          pushed forward close to the German Line,
         E 1 Left only 25 yards from the enemy parapet, with no communication trench, so
         that it could only be reached by night across the open, but this was remedied by
         the construction of a communication trench within a few weeks. An intermittent
         line of support trenches existed but these were shallow and neglected, with no
         communication trenches to the front line, and therefore useless, and unoccupied.
         The only real defensive positions behind the front line were two strong points,
         which were garrisoned by half a Company. The Battalion was distributed with two
         Companies holding the front line and strong points immediately in rear, while
         two Companies were held in support in dug-outs about a mile behind, close to
         Battalion Headquarters at One-Tree Farm. The tour in trenches was four days, the
         Battalion and the 4th Leicester Regiment relieving each other alternately,
         returning to rest in the same billets in <a id="place128" href="place-index.html?n=Dranouter, Heuvelland, Belgium" title="Dranouter, Heuvelland, Belgium">Dranoutre</a>. During the tours in trenches we worked very hard to
         improve the position, draining the trenches, making the communication trenches
         passable, strengthening parapets, constructing loop-holes and firing positions,
         and building bomb-proof shelters; deep dug-outs were unknown in the Spring of
         1915.</p>
      
      <p>In order to strengthen the defence, after the first tour in the trenches it was
         arranged that all the machine guns of both Battalions should remain in position
         in the trenches, and be manned in turn by detachments of machine gunners of the
         Battalion in the line.</p>
      
      <p>This routine continued until <span title="1915-05-02">May 2nd</span>, when a
         slight change was made in the distribution of the trenches allotted to the
         Division and the Battalion "side-slipped" to the left,
         Battalion Headquarters being moved to Lindenhoek Chateau about a mile 
         [<a id="p27" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/27/mode/1up">p27</a>]
         
         north of their former position. On next relieving the 4th Leicestershire
         Regiment on <span title="1915-05-10">May 10th</span> a further change was made in
         distribution, one of the support Companies being moved forward to the newly
         constructed "Regent Street" dug-outs under cover of a ridge
         about 800 yards behind the front line.</p>
      
      <p>An important change in the nomenclature of the Division and Brigade took effect
         on <span title="1915-05-12">May 12th</span>, when the titles of the North Midland
         Division and Lincoln and Leicester Brigade were officially discarded and those
         of the 46th Division and the 138th Brigade adopted in their place. At the same
         time the official designation of the Battalion became the 1/5th Lincolnshire,
         the Reserve Battalion in England being henceforth designated the 2/5th
         Battalion, and the Reserve Division being known as the 59th Division.</p>
      
      <p>Casualties fortunately were few during the early days in the trenches, but on
         <span title="1915-05-13">May 13th</span>
         <a href="people-index.html#Sheel, Harold, Capt" title="Sheel, Harold, Capt" id="pers90">Lieut.
            H. Sheel</a> was
         severely wounded while out on patrol. Up to <span title="1915-05-20">May
            20th</span>, no event of particular importance occurred to break the monotony of
         the usual trench warfare except that on <span title="1915-05-10">May 10th</span>
         just as the Battalion reached Trench Headquarters, at One Tree Farm for the
         usual relief of the 4th Leicestershire Regiment, a message was received that
         Trench E 1 Left had been attacked and occupied by the enemy. The Battalion
         immediately advanced in two lines of Companies in the darkness across the open
         to support the Leicesters, but before the trench line was reached, information
         was received that E 1 Left, which had been rushed by an enemy bombing party, had
         been reoccupied without assistance; the relief was then completed in the usual
         way. The sector held at this period was a very quiet one, shells were
         comparatively rare visitors, practically 
         [<a id="p28" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/28/mode/1up">p28</a>]
          all
         casualties being from rifle or machine gun fire. For some time, however,
         suspicious sounds had been heard underground near Trench E 1 Left, garrisoned by
         a platoon under an officer, and it was realised that the Germans were mining in
         this direction and that the position was dangerous. On <span title="1915-05-20">May 20th</span> at 3 p.m. the mine was exploded under the parapet of the
         trench, which was practically destroyed, many of the garrison being buried and
         the remainder being killed or wounded. The <abbr title="Commanding Officer">C.O.</abbr>, <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers91">Lieut.-Colonel

            Stephenson</a>, had a narrow escape, being on their
         way to visit the trench and at the moment of the explosion were approaching in
         the communication trench not many yards behind. The enemy made no attempt to
         attack, but opened heavy fire on the position, which rendered rescue work very
         difficult, but this was immediately begun together with the construction of a
         temporary parapet under the superintendence of <a href="people-index.html#Gosling, Douglas Edward, Lt (RE, d 1915)" title="Gosling, Douglas Edward, Lt (RE, d 1915)" id="pers93">

            E. Dyson</a>, the
         Officer in Command of the trench, was not rescued until 3 a.m., having been
         buried for twelve hours and the casualties in the garrison and rescue parties
         during the operation amounted to 16 killed and 24 wounded; however, during the
         night the trench was reconstructed and occupied as usual <span title="1915-05-21">next day</span>. The circumstances were reported in due course to the
         Divisional Commander and the following complimentary memorandum was subsequently
         issued from Divisional Headquarters:</p>

      <p>On being relieved on <span title="1915-05-22">May 22nd</span>, the Battalion did
         not return to their old billets, but bivouacked in fields on the Eastern slopes
         of <a id="place130" href="place-index.html?n=Kemmel, Heuvelland, Belgium" title="Kemmel, Heuvelland, Belgium">Kemmel</a> Hill. Bivouac sheets,
         supported on wooden frames, were provided each affording shelter to eight men in
         the form of a tent d'abri with open ends, a wooden hut being erected to serve as
         an Orderly Room and Officers' Mess. During the perfect summer weather which
         prevailed during <span title="1915-05">May</span> and <span title="1915-06">June
            of 1915</span>, the bivouacs were far preferable to crowded billets, and the
         days spent in these bivouacs remain a very happy memory. During the next tour in
         the trenches, from <span title="1915-05-26">May 26th</span> to <span title="1915-05-29">29th</span>, the 7th Battalion of the Rifle Brigade were
         attached for instruction to the Battalion, who were in consequence elated to
         consider themselves veterans, and competent to instruct a unit of the New Armies
         then coming out, from England. During the relief on the evening of <span title="1915-05-30">May 30th</span>, <a href="people-index.html#Dixon, Oscar, Capt" title="Dixon, Oscar, Capt" id="pers98">Lieut.

         on <span title="1915-06-03">June 3rd</span> was commemorated by a burst of rapid
         fire on the German line by each trench garrison at morning "stand
         to" but was not acknowledged by any reply. On <span title="1915-06-06">June 6th</span> our miners detected another German gallery being pushed out
         towards E 1 Left, and a counter mine was successfully prepared and the enemy
         gallery destroyed, our own gallery remaining intact and being maintained as a
         defensive measure. During the tour from <span title="1915-06-10">June 10th</span>
         to <span title="1915-06-14">14th</span>, the 5th Battalion Oxford and Bucks.
         Light Infantry were attached for instruction from the same Division as the 7th
         Rifle Brigade, and gave valuable help in providing working parties for
         improvement of the trenches.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1915-06-18">June 18th</span> the Battalion relieved the 4th
         Leicestershire Regiment and entered on their last tour in the <a id="place131" href="place-index.html?n=Kemmel, Heuvelland, Belgium" title="Kemmel, Heuvelland, Belgium">Kemmel</a> sector, finally leaving it on the <span title="1915-06-21">21st</span>, when they were relieved by a composite
         Battalion of the 50th Division, who had suffered severely during the second
         Battle of <a id="place132" href="place-index.html?n=Ieper, Belgium" title="Ieper, Belgium">Ypres</a>, the 6th and 8th Durham
         Light Infantry, who now took over our comparatively quiet sector opposite the
         <a id="place133" href="place-index.html?n=Mesen, Belgium" title="Mesen, Belgium">Messines</a> Ridge. During our
         occupation our casualties, apart from those caused by the mine explosion in E 1
         Left on <span title="1915-05-20">May 20th</span>, were comparatively few, nearly
         all being bullet wounds, although <a href="people-index.html#Disney, Sydney Cecil William, Maj" title="Disney, Sydney Cecil William, Maj" id="pers100">Lieut.

         weapon just then coming into use. The line was shelled occasionally, but never
         severely, and then only by shrapnel or <abbr title="High Explosive">H.E.</abbr> of small calibre, which did little harm. The weather was perfect and,
         as the ground dried, enabled the position to be greatly improved and
         strengthened. An immense amount of work was done in strengthening parapets; the
         trenches were properly drained and floored, and the two communication trenches
         known as Piccadilly and Regent Street, the latter 
         [<a id="p31" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/31/mode/1up">p31</a>]
          being a new trench constructed by the Battalion, were made
         into deep and safe trenches, so that during the latter part of the time,
         communication with the front line was as easy by day as by night. The strong
         points immediately in the rear of the front line were improved and a new one
         constructed, and the Battalion had the satisfaction of knowing that they left
         the position to their successors far stronger for defence, and far more
         comfortable for habitation, than they found it.</p>
      
      <p>The bivouacs were reached at 1.30 a.m. on <span title="1915-06-22">June
            22nd</span>, after the relief from the trenches, and were occupied for a few
         hours for the last time; at reveillé they were packed and the ground cleared,
         and in the afternoon the Battalion was inspected by the Corps Commander,

         done in the trenches, expressed great satisfaction with the parade and his
         confidence that the Battalion would, when their chance came, prove themselves as
         good in open warfare as they had done in trenches. At 8.15 p.m. the Battalion
         paraded and marched to the North, through <a id="place134" href="place-index.html?n=Loker, Heuvelland, Belgium" title="Loker, Heuvelland, Belgium">Locre</a> and <a id="place135">Zevecoten</a>,
