      <h2>Introductory</h2>
      
      <p>The 5th (Territorial) Battalion of the Lincolnshire Regiment came into being on
         <span title="1908-04-01">1st April 1908</span>, as the result of the
         Territorial and Reserve Forces Act of <span title="1907">1907</span>, according
         to the scheme which required two Infantry Battalions to be raised in the County
         of Lincolnshire, these two battalions with the 4th and 5th Battalions of the
         Leicestershire Regiment forming the Lincoln and Leicester Brigade of the North
         Midland Division of the Territorial Force. The other Brigades in the Division
         were the Notts and Derby (Sherwood Foresters) Brigade, composed of the 5th, 6th,
         7th and 8th Battalions of the Notts and Derby Regiment, and the Staffordshire
         Brigade, composed of the 5th and 6th Battalions of the South Staffordshire and
         North Staffordshire Regiments respectively.</p>
      
      <p>It is desirable to trace very briefly the history of the Volunteer Force (the
         predecessor of the Territorial Force) in Lincolnshire. Under the Volunteer Act
         of 1859, numerous companies of Rifle Volunteers were raised in the county; these
         were subsequently formed into two "Administrative Battalions",
         which ultimately became the 1st and 2nd Volunteer Battalions of the County
         Regiment. Apart from the question of their real value as a military force, upon
         which opinions were divided, there is no doubt that the Volunteers were most
         useful in promoting and encouraging the art of rifle shooting, and it is note­
         worthy that the Queen's Prize at the National Rifle 
         [<a id="p2" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/2/mode/1up">p2</a>]
          Association's meeting was won in successive years 1886 and
         1887 by <a href="people-index.html#Bulmer, Sgt (VF)" title="Bulmer, Sgt (VF)" id="pers54">

            Jackson
            </a> of the 1st Battalion (subsequently Captain and Quartermaster of the
         5th Battalion).</p>
      
      <p>During the South African War, when two Volunteer Companies for Active Service
         were raised and sent out to South Africa from the Volunteer Battalions in
         Lincolnshire, recruiting for the whole force was greatly stimulated and in 1900
         the 1st Volunteer Battalion composed of eleven Companies in the City of
         <a id="place4" href="place-index.html?n=Lincoln, England" title="Lincoln, England">Lincoln</a> and northern area of the
         County was greatly above its establishment, and was redistributed to form two 8
         Company Battalions, the 1st <abbr title="Volunteer">V.</abbr> Battalion with Headquarters at <a id="place5" href="place-index.html?n=Lincoln, England" title="Lincoln, England">Lincoln</a>, and the 3rd <abbr title="Volunteer">V.</abbr> Battalion with Headquarters at <a id="place6" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a>, while the 2nd <abbr title="Volunteer">V.</abbr> Battalion was recruited from South Lincolnshire, Headquarters being at
         <a id="place7" href="place-index.html?n=Grantham, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grantham, Lincolnshire, England">Grantham</a>.</p>
      
      <p>This organization continued until 1908, when only two Infantry Battalions of the
         Territorial Force were required in place of the three Volunteer Battalions.
         After much discussion it was decided by the County Association to raise the 4th
         Territorial Battalion from the City of <a id="place8" href="place-index.html?n=Lincoln, England" title="Lincoln, England">Lincoln</a> and <a id="place9" href="place-index.html?n=Horncastle, Lincolnshire, England" title="Horncastle, Lincolnshire, England">Horncastle</a>
         districts of the old 1st <abbr title="Volunteer">V.</abbr> Battalion, together with the area in the south of the county from
         which the 2nd <abbr title="Volunteer">V.</abbr> Battalion had been recruited, whilst the 5th Battalion should be
         raised from the area of the old 3rd <abbr title="Volunteer">V.</abbr> Battalion, together with the <a id="place10" href="place-index.html?n=Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England" title="Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England">Gainsborough</a> district of the 1st, with the distribution of
         Companies as follows: Headquarters and two Companies with Machine Gun Section at
         <a id="place11" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a>, and one Company each at
         <a id="place12" href="place-index.html?n=Spilsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Spilsby, Lincolnshire, England">Spilsby</a>, <a id="place13" href="place-index.html?n=Louth, Lincolnshire, England" title="Louth, Lincolnshire, England">Louth</a>, <a id="place14" href="place-index.html?n=Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, England" title="Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, England">Barton-on-Humber</a>, <a id="place15" href="place-index.html?n=Alford, Lincolnshire, England" title="Alford, Lincolnshire, England">Alford</a>,

      <p>It is interesting to note the widely different character of the population in the
         various districts. The <a id="place18" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a> recruits
         were chiefly drawn from men 
         [<a id="p3" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/3/mode/1up">p3</a>]
          employed in the
         fishing industry and in the docks; <a id="place19" href="place-index.html?n=Louth, Lincolnshire, England" title="Louth, Lincolnshire, England">Louth</a>, <a id="place20" href="place-index.html?n=Spilsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Spilsby, Lincolnshire, England">Spilsby</a>, and
         <a id="place21" href="place-index.html?n=Alford, Lincolnshire, England" title="Alford, Lincolnshire, England">Alford</a> were purely agricultural
         centres; <a id="place22" href="place-index.html?n=Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England" title="Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England">Gainsborough</a> furnished chiefly
         mechanics employed in the Engineering works; <a id="place23" href="place-index.html?n=Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, England" title="Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, England">Scunthorpe</a> recruited from the sturdy workers in the iron-stone
         and smelting industries, and from agricultural workers in the <a id="place24" href="place-index.html?n=Brigg, Lincolnshire, England" title="Brigg, Lincolnshire, England">Brigg</a> district; <a id="place25" href="place-index.html?n=Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, England" title="Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, England">Barton-on-Humber</a> provided recruits chiefly from the mechanics
         in the cycle works, of a type similar to those of <a id="place26" href="place-index.html?n=Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England" title="Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England">Gainsborough</a>. This great diversity of civil occupation proved
         of immense advantage on mobilization, as the necessary skilled men were
         comparatively easily obtained for all the "specialist" duties
         required.</p>
      
      <p>The Commanding Officer on the formation of the Battalion was <a href="people-index.html#Walker, George Beaumont, Col" title="Walker, George Beaumont, Col" id="pers56">Lieut.-Col. (Hon. Colonel) G. B.
            Walker</a>, <abbr title="Volunteer Decoration">V.D.</abbr>, <a href="people-index.html#Stephenson, Harold, Maj" title="Stephenson, Harold, Maj" id="pers57">Major
            H.
            Stephenson</a>, who had served with a Volunteer
         Company in the South African War, being second-in-command; whilst <a href="people-index.html#Birch, S C, Capt" title="Birch, S C, Capt" id="pers58">Captain
            S. C.
            Birch</a>, Northumberland Fusiliers, who had
         been serving as Adjutant of the 3rd Volunteer Battalion, was appointed Adjutant.
         In a country battalion, recruiting from a wide and comparatively sparsely
         populated area, as this battalion was, the raising and training of the various
         companies depended very largely on the local officers commanding them; the
         Battalion, as such, only assembled at the Annual Training in Camp, and much
         initiative and hard work was required and, to their great credit, usually
         obtained from the Company Officers during the years preceding mobilization.</p>
      
      <p>In view of the more stringent regulations with regard to efficiency in the
         newly-constituted Territorial Force compared with those of the old Volunteers,
         and the consequent diminution in numbers which acceptance of the new conditions
         
         [<a id="p4" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/4/mode/1up">p4</a>]
          involved, it was thought desirable to
         attempt to popularize the new Service and stimulate recruiting by holding the
         annual camp for Battalion training at a seaside resort, if possible within the
         Battalion's recruiting area. Accordingly in 1908 the annual training took place
         at <a id="place27" href="place-index.html?n=Skegness, Lincolnshire, England" title="Skegness, Lincolnshire, England">Skegness</a>, the period of training
         being now fourteen days, in place of seven days formerly required of the
         Volunteers as a maximum. It was speedily found, however, that although in
         Companies like <a id="place28" href="place-index.html?n=Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England" title="Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England">Gainsborough</a> and
         <a id="place29" href="place-index.html?n=Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, England" title="Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, England">Scunthorpe</a>, where the great majority
         of the men were employed in works, which closed for a fourteen days' holiday,
         the greater proportion of the men could and did undergo the full period of
         training, in the Companies recruited from the agricultural areas it was not
         possible to get the majority of the men to perform more than seven days'
         continuous training in Camp. These conditions continued in subsequent years, and
         the efficiency of the Battalion suffered in consequence. During the drill
         season, recruit drills, company drills, musketry training, range practices and
         all work that could be performed at Company Headquarters, were carried out
         without much difficulty, and the results were satisfactory as far as they went,
         but the time for Battalion training, accustoming the Companies to work with each
         other, and above all for the inculcation of discipline, as understood in the
         Service, was far too short to allow of any really satisfactory result, although
         slow but steady improvement was attained year by year. The standard of conduct
         in the individual in the Battalion was high, very high; the keenness, the
         enthusiasm, the desire to learn their work, and the general willingness of the
         men to obey commands was noteworthy; but the unquestioning obedience, the
         automatic response to an order, the unbreakable chain of responsibility, 
         [<a id="p5" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/5/mode/1up">p5</a>]
          the high morale, the sense of comradeship and
         esprit de corps, which exist as a matter of course in a highly disciplined
         Battalion, only existed, as in the Territorial Force generally, in outline. How
         that outline was worthily filled up in 1914 and the following years, will be
         seen in the subsequent history of the Battalion.</p>
      
      <p>The Annual Training at <a id="place30" href="place-index.html?n=Skegness, Lincolnshire, England" title="Skegness, Lincolnshire, England">Skegness</a> in 1908
         was not of a very arduous character, and every effort was made to render
         training in Camp attractive and popular. Much good work was done however,
         Company and Battalion drill were assiduously practised, the elements of
         manoeuvre were learnt, and the general standard of efficiency at the end of
         fourteen days was notably improved.</p>
      
      <p>At the ceremony of the presentation of Colours to the units of the Territorial
         Force at <a id="place31" href="place-index.html?n=Windsor, Berkshire, England" title="Windsor, Berkshire, England">Windsor</a> Castle in the summer of
         1909, a detachment of the Battalion was present, and the Colours were received
         from the hands of <a href="people-index.html#Edward VII, King" title="Edward VII, King" id="pers59">

      <p>The Annual Training in 1909 took place at <a id="place33" href="place-index.html?n=Garendon Park, Leicestershire, England" title="Garendon Park, Leicestershire, England">Garendon Park</a>, Leicestershire, where the newly-formed Lincoln and
         Leicester Brigade was brought together for the first time under the command of
         the Brigadier, <a href="people-index.html#Carthew-Yorstoun, A M, Col" title="Carthew-Yorstoun, A M, Col" id="pers62">Col.
            A. M.
            Carthew-Yorstoun</a>. The training was of the
         usual nature, chiefly Company and Battalion work, with two days of combined
         Brigade training. The weather was very fine, hot and dry, and a serious heath
         fire occurred in the neighbourhood, which the Battalion assisted to subdue; in
         recognition of their services, the owner of the property forwarded a cheque for
         £50 to Battalion Funds.</p>
      
      <p>In 1910, the Annual Training was carried out at <a id="place34" href="place-index.html?n=Buxton, Derbyshire, England" title="Buxton, Derbyshire, England">Buxton</a>, where a Brigade Camp was again formed, and more
         extended Brigade and Battalion manoeuvre

          was
         practised than in the previous year, as a large stretch of open land was
         available. Unfortunately, the weather this year was very bad during the greater
         part of the time, and seriously interfered with the training programme.</p>
      
      <p>In 1911 the Battalion again performed their Annual Training in a Brigade Camp at
         <a id="place35" href="place-index.html?n=Garendon Park, Leicestershire, England" title="Garendon Park, Leicestershire, England">Garendon Park</a> under favourable
         weather conditions. To the great regret of all ranks, the tenure of <a href="people-index.html#Birch, S C, Capt" title="Birch, S C, Capt" id="pers63">Captain
            S. C.
            Birch</a>'s appointment as Adjutant came to an
         end at the termination of this training. The Battalion owes much to him; an
         excellent instructor, he devoted himself most loyally to promote efficiency in
         every way, especially in musketry, and his efforts were rewarded by a steady
         yearly improvement. He was succeeded by <a href="people-index.html#Richardson, J F, Capt" title="Richardson, J F, Capt" id="pers64">Captain

      <p>In <span title="1912">1912</span> it was decided to assemble for the Annual
         Training the whole of the North Midland Division, under <a href="people-index.html#Hamilton, Hubert Ian Wetherall, Maj-Gen" title="Hamilton, Hubert Ian Wetherall, Maj-Gen" id="pers69">
            Major-General

         Divisional Training was very elementary but extremely valuable, enabling units
         of different Arms to obtain a rough idea of how to 
         [<a id="p7" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/7/mode/1up">p7</a>]
          work together, and affording an opportunity for Infantry to
         watch the work of other Arms, especially Artillery. Owing to the long marches
         necessary in Divisional operations the training was strenuous and exhausting,
         but all ranks worked well, and the Divisional Commander was very satisfied with
         the result.</p>

      <p>In 1913, in contrast to Divisional training of the previous year, it was thought
         desirable to carry out the Annual Training of the Infantry in Battalion Camps,
         in order to give an opportunity of carefully supervising the elementary training
         of sections and companies, especially in musketry and fire control, together
         with Company and Battalion Drill, while manoeuvre was limited to inter-company
         schemes. The ground selected, Stoke Rochfort Park, near <a id="place41" href="place-index.html?n=Grantham, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grantham, Lincolnshire, England">Grantham</a>, was admirably suited for the purpose,
         the weather good, and the benefit of careful training of subordinate commanders
         at the Camp was clearly felt in the following year. With the exception of one
         day's inspection by the Divisional Commander, the training was entirely in the
         hands of the <a href="people-index.html#Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" title="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" id="pers790">

            Carthew-Yorstoun</a>, the Annual Training for 1914 was planned as a Brigade Camp at
         <a id="place42" href="place-index.html?n=Bridlington, Yorkshire, England" title="Bridlington, Yorkshire, England">Bridlington</a>, but after the first
         week was rudely interrupted by the outbreak of the Great War.</p>
      
      <p>The Battalion in the summer of 1914 was considerably below establishment both in
         officers and other ranks; recruiting then, as always, was slow and difficult; a
         large number of the old Volunteers, who joined the Territorial Force on its
         formation and served for four years, had not renewed their engagement, finding
         themselves unable to fulfil the required conditions for efficiency in the
         Territorial Force. On the other hand the standard of efficiency and military
         knowledge had been gradually and slowly raised during the past six years,
         although still falling far short of that at which we aimed. A good Machine Gun
         Section had been formed and trained by <a href="people-index.html#Dixon, Oscar, Capt" title="Dixon, Oscar, Capt" id="pers76">Lieut.
            O. Dixon</a>, who
         was a thoroughly competent instructor and the Signalling Section under <a href="people-index.html#Ingoldby, Frederick John Willow, Maj" title="Ingoldby, Frederick John Willow, Maj" id="pers77">Lieut.
            F. J.
            M.
            Ingoldby</a>, had made good progress.</p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1914-07-25">July 25th, 1914</span>, the two Lincolnshire
         Battalions assembled at <a id="place43" href="place-index.html?n=Bridlington, Yorkshire, England" title="Bridlington, Yorkshire, England">Bridlington</a>, and
         carried out the usual training for a week, being joined on <span title="1914-08-02">August 2nd</span> (Sunday) by the Leicestershire
         Battalions to complete the Brigade. On that day, however, it became known that,
         owing to the threatening political situation and the imminent risk of war, the
         training would be interrupted and orders were subsequently received for all
         Battalions to return to their Headquarters next day. On <span title="1914-08-03">Monday evening, August 3rd</span>, the Battalion left camp and marched to
         <a id="place44" href="place-index.html?n=Bridlington, Yorkshire, England" title="Bridlington, Yorkshire, England">Bridlington</a> station, the first half
         Battalion leaving at once, and reaching their various stations next morning; the
         train for the second half, however, 
         [<a id="p9" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/9/mode/1up">p9</a>]
          was many
         hours late, and did not leave till 9 a.m. on <span title="1914-08-04">Tuesday,
            the 4th</span>, the Companies not arriving at their respective destinations
         until late in the afternoon. Thus ended the Peace Training of <span title="1914">1914</span>; next day, <span title="1914-08-05">Wednesday, August
            5th</span>, the Battalion was mobilized for War.</p>
