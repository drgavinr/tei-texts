      <h2>The Reconstitution of the Battalion</h2>
      
      <p>The War History of the Battalion may be fittingly deemed terminated with the return
         of the Cadre from France and the ceremony of
         depositing the Colours in the Parish Church at <a id="pl1t" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a>.
         </p>
      
      <p>Thereafter occurred an interregnum in its activities, as in the case of all other
         Territorial Battalions after the war.
         </p>
      
      <p>The Quartermaster, <a href="people-index.html#Plumtree, William Henry, Capt" title="Plumtree, William Henry, Capt" id="ps1t">Captain W. H. Plumtree</a>, with <a href="people-index.html#Uppleby, Percy, Lt" title="Uppleby, Percy, Lt" id="ps2t">Lieut. P. Uppleby</a>, who had remained in France with the baggage party, proceeded to <a id="pl2t" href="place-index.html?n=Boulogne-sur-Mer, France" title="Boulogne-sur-Mer, France">Boulogne</a> on <span title="1919-07-25">July 25th, 1919</span>, and from there were sent to <a id="pl3t" href="place-index.html?n=Clipstone, Nottinghamshire, England" title="Clipstone, Nottinghamshire, England">Clipstone</a> for demobilization.
         </p>
      
      <p>On returning to <a id="pl4t" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a> <a href="people-index.html#Plumtree, William Henry, Capt" title="Plumtree, William Henry, Capt" id="ps3t">Capt. Plumtree</a> found the Drill Hall still in occupation of the 3rd <abbr title="Volunteer Battalion">V.B.</abbr> Lincolnshire Regiment, and this continued until <span title="1920-02">February, 1920</span>.
         </p>
      
      <p>This period of suspended animation may be considered as terminating on <span title="1920-02-16">February 16th, 1920</span>, on which date recruiting for the Territorial Force was reopened by Army Order 42;
         <a href="people-index.html#Plumtree, William Henry, Capt" title="Plumtree, William Henry, Capt" id="ps4t">Captain Plumtree</a> took over the Drill Hall from the Volunteers, and <a href="people-index.html#Taylor, Frederick, 4792367" title="Taylor, Frederick, 4792367" id="ps5t">Regimental Sergt.-Major F. Taylor</a> arrived from the Depot Lincolnshire Regiment.
         </p>
      
      <p>A number of temporary recruiters, mostly from Highland Regiments, simultaneously arrived
         at the various out-stations.
         </p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1920-02-25">February 25th, 1920</span>, notification was received from the Lincoln County Association of the re- appointment
         of <a href="people-index.html#Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" title="Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" id="ps6t">Lieut.-Colonel H. G. Wilson, <abbr title="Distinguished Service Order">D.S.O.</abbr>, <abbr title="Territorial Decoration">T.D.</abbr></a>, to the Command of the Battalion, and on

         had held this appointment.
         </p>

      <p>
         The following officers were appointed in June:</p>

      </ul>
      
      <p>
         The introduction of the 4 Company system since
         mobilization  in  August, 1914, necessitated  a re-arrangement  of   outstations 
         and   the   following
         distribution was decided on by the Commanding
         Officer.

      <p>This was modified later on account of recruiting at <a id="pl14t" href="place-index.html?n=Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England" title="Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England">Gainsborough</a> being excellent, whilst that at <a id="pl15t" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a> and <a id="pl16t" href="place-index.html?n=Brigg, Lincolnshire, England" title="Brigg, Lincolnshire, England">Brigg</a> was bad, and the final situation
         
         [<a id="p200" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/200/mode/1up">p200</a>]
          was that <a id="pl17t" href="place-index.html?n=Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, England" title="Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, England">Barton</a> was allotted to <a id="pl18t" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a> until such time as the Machine Gun Platoon should be formed. <a id="pl19t" href="place-index.html?n=Brigg, Lincolnshire, England" title="Brigg, Lincolnshire, England">Brigg</a>, having no Drill Hall, was abolished and <a id="pl20t" href="place-index.html?n=Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England" title="Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England">Gainsborough</a> and <a id="pl21t" href="place-index.html?n=Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, England" title="Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, England">Scunthorpe</a> each allotted a complete Company.
         </p>
      
      <p>In July three more officers were appointed: <a href="people-index.html#Hall, Bryan Clapham, Capt" title="Hall, Bryan Clapham, Capt" id="ps18t">Captain B. C. Hall</a>, an old member of the Battalion; <a href="people-index.html#Gibson, N, Lt" title="Gibson, N, Lt" id="ps19t">Lieut. N. Gibson</a>, from the 4th East Yorkshire Regiment; <a href="people-index.html#Linley, Hugh Banks, Capt" title="Linley, Hugh Banks, Capt" id="ps20t">Lieut. Linley</a>, the Battalion Transport Officer during the war, who was shortly promoted Captain
         and assumed Command of C Company.
         </p>
      
      <p>The strength of the Battalion at the end of July was 10 Officers and 48 Other Ranks.
         </p>
      
      <p>The Annual Training for 1920 was held at <a id="pl22t" href="place-index.html?n=Skegness, Lincolnshire, England" title="Skegness, Lincolnshire, England">Skegness</a> from <span title="1920-07-25">July 25th</span> to <span title="1920-08-08">August 8th</span>. Owing to the small numbers, however, the Battalion did not proceed as a Unit but
         a detachment was formed of those desiring to attend and was attached to the 4th Battalion.
         </p>
      
      <p><a href="people-index.html#Linley, Hugh Banks, Capt" title="Linley, Hugh Banks, Capt" id="ps21t">Capt. H. B. Linley</a> was in Command and <a href="people-index.html#Plumtree, William Henry, Capt" title="Plumtree, William Henry, Capt" id="ps22t">Capt. W. H. Plumtree</a> and 39 other ranks proceeded.
         </p>
      
      <p>The Commanding Officer and Adjutant paid several visits to the detachment but did not remain throughout the period as
         all Drill Halls were kept open for recruiting purposes.
         </p>
      
      <p>Recruiting began to improve about this time as the following extracts from the strength
         returns will show —

            </ul>
         </p>
      
      <p>This was very largely on account of the excellent recruiting at <a id="pl23t" href="place-index.html?n=Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England" title="Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England">Gainsborough</a> due to the unaided efforts of <a href="people-index.html#Linley, Hugh Banks, Capt" title="Linley, Hugh Banks, Capt" id="ps23t">Capt. H. B. Linley</a>, who had no subalterns to assist him.

      <p>A summary of the strength by detachments will be of interest at this point.

      <p>C Company thus held the proud position of easily being the first Company to raise
         its full establishment, and as recruits continued to present themselves the Commanding
         Officer decided to raise a proportion of the Headquarter Unit there in order not to
         stop intending recruits joining.
         </p>
      
      <p>Consequently band, drums, signallers, transport and pioneers were allotted to this
         detachment in addition to the Company.
         </p>
      
      <p>The following officers had been gazetted during the above period:
         </p>
      
      <p><a href="people-index.html#Hadfield, James Henry, Maj" title="Hadfield, James Henry, Maj" id="ps24t">Major J. H. Hadfield</a>, who had served continuously in the Battalion since 1900, and who though suffering
         from the effects of wounds received in action was specially re-appointed to assist
         in the period of reconstruction.
         </p>
      
      <p>The narrative has now been brought up to the commencement of April, 1921, and notices
         were appearing in orders regarding the Annual Training at <a id="pl31t" href="place-index.html?n=Skegness, Lincolnshire, England" title="Skegness, Lincolnshire, England">Skegness</a> when an event occurred which had far reaching consequences on the Battalion, as on
         the country in general; but whereas in the latter case these consequences were serious,
         in the former they were fraught with good results.
         </p>
      
      <p>The national coal strike is referred to.
         
         [<a id="p202" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/202/mode/1up">p202</a>]
          Though this is not a history of the Defence Force Battalion, its affairs are so intimately
         connected with that of the Battalion proper, and had such far reaching results on
         it that some reference is necessary.
         </p>
      
      <p>On <span title="1921-04-08">April 8th, 1921</span>, the Commanding Officer and Adjutant were summoned to the Brigade Headquarters at <a id="pl32t" href="place-index.html?n=Lincoln, England" title="Lincoln, England">Lincoln</a> by telephone and there was a conference on arrangements to be made should it be necessary
         to raise a Citizen Force for the protection of the vital needs of the Country.
         </p>
      
      <p>On their way back to <a id="pl33t" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a> in an evening paper bought at <a id="pl34t" href="place-index.html?n=Retford, Nottinghamshire, England" title="Retford, Nottinghamshire, England">Retford</a>, they saw that the necessity had actually arisen, and the following morning's papers
         had full details of the call to the nation.
         </p>
      
      <p>Thereafter began a period of work to which the mobilization of August, 1914, was child's
         play.
         </p>
      
      <p>Then a carefully prepared scheme was available to work on, and an existing Battalion
         had only to be mobilized. Now not only had a new Battalion to be raised, armed, clothed
         and equipped; for the Territorial Battalion was not mobilized; but all arrangements
         had to be improvised as the work progressed and the Battalion grew in numbers.
         </p>
      
      <p>Battalion Headquarters were opened at the <a id="pl35t" href="place-index.html?n=Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" title="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England">Grimsby</a> Drill Hall; recruiting being simultaneously carried out at all the Company headquarters
         and outstations.
         </p>
      
      <p>The response was excellent and on <span title="1921-04-18">April 18th, 1921</span>, on which date recruiting was stopped, the strength of the 5th Lincolnshire Regiment
         Defence Force was 28 officers and 513 other ranks.
         </p>
      
      <p>Had recruiting not been stopped, the Battalion would have been at full peace strength
         in another 24 hours.
         </p>
      
      <p>The following officers of the Territorial Battalion took Commissions in the Defence

      <p>Large numbers of the <abbr title="Warrant Officers">W.O.'s</abbr>, <abbr title="non-commissioned officers">N.C.O.'s</abbr> and men of the Territorial Battalion enlisted into the Defence Force Battalion.
         </p>
      
      <p>The Battalion was concentrated at the old Royal Naval Air Force station at <a id="pl36t" href="place-index.html?n=North Killingholme, Lincolnshire, England" title="North Killingholme, Lincolnshire, England">Killingholme</a> on <span title="1921-04-25">April 25th</span> and remained there until the Defence Force was dispersed on <span title="1921-07-07">July 7th, 1921</span>, during which period it had been inspected by the <abbr title="General Officer Commanding">G.O.C.</abbr> 46th North Midland Division and Brigade Commander, Lincoln and Leicester Brigade, receiving most complimentary reports in each case.
         </p>
      
      <p>The result of this embodiment of a Battalion based on the Drill Halls and organization
         of the Territorial Battalion and bearing practically the same designation was most
         marked.
         </p>
      
      <p>In one year only 220 men had been raised; chiefly owing to the apathy that existed
         after the war. Men that had served through it had had enough soldiering whilst only
         the fringe had been touched in the case of the younger men who had been under military
         age at the time of the armistice.
         </p>
      
      <p>Of these 220 men over one-half came from one station.
         </p>
      
      <p>The rush of recruits for the Defence Force, at a time when there was every prospect
         of serious work in front of it at very short notice, showed that the old spirit, that
         brought men flocking to the Colours
         
         [<a id="p204" href="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/204/mode/1up">p204</a>]
          in 1914, was not dead; whilst the numbers at each Company Headquarters before the
         concentration at <a id="pl37t" href="place-index.html?n=North Killingholme, Lincolnshire, England" title="North Killingholme, Lincolnshire, England">Killingholme</a>, called the attention of local inhabitants of military age to the fact that a Battalion
         did exist in their midst, though they had, apparently been almost unaware of the fact.
         </p>
      
      <p>During the embodiment period officers had taken the opportunity to bring before their
         men the advantages of the Territorial Army and to sow the seed that should bring forth
         the crop at the appointed time.
         </p>
      
      <p>Directly the orders for the dispersal of the Defence Force were received, recruiting
         for the Territorial Battalion was opened and the results were more than gratifying.
         </p>
      
      <p>Attestations had been prepared beforehand so that in many cases all that remained
         to do was to swear the men in. This could not be done till the day of their discharge
         from the Defence Force.
         </p>
      
      <p>Fresh recruits, who had not served in the Defence Force, also commenced to present
         themselves for enlistment right up till the departure of the Territorial Battalion
         for its Annual Training at <a id="pl38t" href="place-index.html?n=Skegness, Lincolnshire, England" title="Skegness, Lincolnshire, England">Skegness</a> on <span title="1921-07-27">July 27th</span>.
         </p>
      
      <p>Similarly as regards officers.
         </p>
      
      <p>The old officers of the Battalion who had not been reappointed until the Defence Force
         mobilization, but rejoined at this period were:
         </p>
      
      <p><a href="people-index.html#Hitzen, Edo John, Capt" title="Hitzen, Edo John, Capt" id="ps34t">Captain E. J. Hitzen</a>, the senior Captain, who joined the Defence Force as Assistant Adjutant and was reappointed
         to the Territorial Force Battalion, taking over Command of A Company.

      <p><a href="people-index.html#Cowling, W, Capt" title="Cowling, W, Capt" id="ps35t">Captain W. Cowling</a>, whose reappointment to the Battalion proper and to the Defence Force practically
         coincided.
         </p>
      
      <p>Of the officers who had not previously served in the Battalion before the Defence
         Force, but from

          the latter were appointed to Commissions in it, there were four:

         </ul>
         </p>
      
      <p>The result of all the above is best summed up by
         giving the strength of the Battalion as at <span title="1921-08-01">August
            1st, 1921</span>.
         
         </p>
      
      <p>Officers 18, other ranks 425.
         A gain of 205 men in four months.
         The final figures that will be quoted as of interest
         are those showing strength and distribution of the
         Battalion on April 1st, 1922, two years after the
         opening of recruiting and one year after the mobilization of the Defence Force.

      <p>This appears to be the point at which an account of the reorganization may be brought
         to a close.
         </p>
      
      <p>Much has been accomplished in two years, much remains to be done, but it may be fairly

      <p>The reorganization cannot be said to be complete till the full peace establishment

          older members of the Battalion, who saw service in the great war, is that their allotted
         span of soldiering is drawing to a close and it is to the younger generation that
         one must look to carry on those great traditions that have been built up in the past
         by their predecessors in the 5th Battalion the Lincolnshire Regiment.
         </p>
      
      <p>To members of the young generation must they hold out every encouragement and inducement
         to join; and whom, having joined, must they endeavour to assist by imparting such
         knowledge as they themselves have gained in long years of service to King and Country.
