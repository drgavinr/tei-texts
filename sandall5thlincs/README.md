## Introduction

This is a digital edition of an official history of 1/5th Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment in the First World War, written by a former commanding officer and published in 1922.

The 1/5th Battalion was a first-line Territorial battalion. It was formed in 1908 at the creation of the Territorial Force. In peacetime, it was composed of volunteers who undertook part-time training. The battalion was mobilized for war service in August 1914 and recruited up to war strength with volunteers until the introduction of conscription in 1916. It was disembodied at the end of its war service in 1919 and reconstituted as part of the Territorial Army in 1920.

The first version of this digital edition was published in 2008 and an updated version was published in February 2012, including the final chapter by G.H. Teall on the post-war reconstitution of the battalion, which came out of copyright in 2010. It has now been further updated. The new indexes of people and places in the earlier versions of the digital edition relied on the Exhibit API, which no longer works. They have now been replaced by static HTML pages. Where people and places have been identified, links to external identifiers are provided. Page images are now at the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/mode/1up).
