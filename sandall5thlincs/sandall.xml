                    <p>Text was captured from page images using FineReader OCR software. Automated checks and manual proofreading were carried out to reduce OCR errors.</p>
                    <p>Where the source text is obviously wrong and the correct version can be supplied, corrections have been made and marked with <gi>corr</gi> tag. eg &quot;Fouquevillers&quot; in index occurs between &quot;Foch&quot; and &quot;Fonsomme&quot;, and the pages referenced only mention &quot;Fonquevillers&quot;. These corrections have been made only to restore internal consistency, not to introduce correct French spellings of place names, eg &quot;Fonquevillers&quot; has been maintained even though the correct modern French spelling is &quot;Foncquevillers&quot;.</p>
                    <p>Corrections have been supplied for all errors found so there is currently no need for <gi>sic</gi> tags.</p>
                </correction>
                <normalization>
                    <p>The project aims to represent the original text as closely as possible. Place names have been kept as given in the text even if they are wrong, and have only been corrected for internal consistency. Some changes to style and unctuation have been made.</p>
                    <p>Italic text is not represented in this edition, but occurs only rarely in the source text.</p>
                    <p>Running heads and page numbers have been omitted.</p>
                    <p>Dashes which serve no useful purpose have been deleted. Dashes used for &quot;ditto&quot; in index have been silently replaced by a copy of the preceeding index term.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&quot; has been replaced by &quot;1&quot; where it has been used in an otherwise Arabic number (eg I9I4, I/5th Battalion) but retained where the correct form is a Roman numeral (eg I Corps).</p>
                    <p>Hyphens have been removed from abbreviations consisting of single letters separated by full points (eg R.-Q.-M.-S. becomes R.Q.M.S.) but retained where there are multiple letters between points (eg Lt.-Col., L.-Cpl.). There should be no spaces in either case (R.S.M. not R. S. M.). Initials of names are separated by full points and space (T. E. Sandall not T.E. Sandall).</p>
                    <p>Full points have been deleted from abbreviations for metric units (cm not c.m.) but retained in a.m. and p.m.</p>
                    <p>Apostrophes have been maintained in plural abbreviations (eg N.C.O.'s).</p>
                    <p>Smalls caps have been replaced with normal text.</p>
                    <p>The lists of companies and platoons in chapter 22 have been rearranged to make marking up the structure easier. In future these might better be represented as tables instead of lists.</p>

                <quotation marks="all">
                    <p>Original quotation marks have been retained and not marked up as features. All quotes in source text are double, not single. Blockquotes have been marked with <gi>quote</gi> tags.</p>
                </quotation>
                <hyphenation eol="hard">
                    <p>Line breaks and soft hyphens have been silently removed. All hyphens left in text are consistently hard in the source text as confirmed by use of the same term hyphenated in the middle of a line elsewhere in the text.</p>

                <head>Preface</head>
                <p>The following pages have been written at the suggestion of <persName key="Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/4810476" xml:id="pers1"><roleName type="military">Lieut.-Col.</roleName>

                            <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>, <choice>
                        <abbr>D.S.O.</abbr>
                        <expan>Distinguished Service Order</expan></choice>, the present Commanding Officer of the Battalion, who has given me
                    most valuable assistance, both in furnishing me with all the material and
                    information at his disposal, and in very kindly arranging for the publication of
                    the volume.</p>
                <p>No attempt has been made, except in so far as is necessary to render the
                    narrative intelligible, to describe the military operations in which the
                    Battalion took part, as it appears outside the scope of a simple Battalion
                    record to deal adequately with tactical situations, which would necessarily
                    involve the consideration of the actions of other units and higher formations.</p>
                <p>Some errors in a record such as this, compiled from many different sources, are
                    almost inevitable, and for these I must plead forgiveness as well as for many
                    omissions, which those who know the story of the Battalion will no doubt detect.
                    It must be remembered, however, that in the stress of active service much good
                    work by individuals passes unnoticed, many gallant actions are performed that
                    are never placed on record, and I can only hope that, in spite of its numerous
                    defects, what I have written may be deemed an adequate record and worthy of the
                    Battalion, to which all who served with it were proud to belong.</p>
                <p>I desire to tender my sincere thanks to all those who have placed materials at my
                    disposal on which a narrative could be based, especially <persName key="Wilson, Harold Graham, Lt-Col" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/4810476" xml:id="pers2"><roleName type="military">Lieut.-Col.</roleName>

                <p>The 5th (Territorial) Battalion of the Lincolnshire Regiment came into being on
                        <date when="1908-04-01">1st April 1908</date>, as the result of the
                    Territorial and Reserve Forces Act of <date when="1907">1907</date>, according
                    to the scheme which required two Infantry Battalions to be raised in the County
                    of Lincolnshire, these two battalions with the 4th and 5th Battalions of the
                    Leicestershire Regiment forming the Lincoln and Leicester Brigade of the North
                    Midland Division of the Territorial Force. The other Brigades in the Division
                    were the Notts and Derby (Sherwood Foresters) Brigade, composed of the 5th, 6th,
                    7th and 8th Battalions of the Notts and Derby Regiment, and the Staffordshire
                    Brigade, composed of the 5th and 6th Battalions of the South Staffordshire and
                    North Staffordshire Regiments respectively.</p>
                <p>It is desirable to trace very briefly the history of the Volunteer Force (the
                    predecessor of the Territorial Force) in Lincolnshire. Under the Volunteer Act
                    of 1859, numerous companies of Rifle Volunteers were raised in the county; these
                    were subsequently formed into two &quot;Administrative Battalions&quot;,
                    which ultimately became the 1st and 2nd Volunteer Battalions of the County
                    Regiment. Apart from the question of their real value as a military force, upon
                    which opinions were divided, there is no doubt that the Volunteers were most
                    useful in promoting and encouraging the art of rifle shooting, and it is note­
                    worthy that the Queen's Prize at the National Rifle <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/2/mode/1up" xml:id="p2"/> Association's meeting was won in successive years 1886 and
                    1887 by <persName key="Bulmer, Sgt (VF)" xml:id="pers54">

                    5th Battalion).</p>
                <p>During the South African War, when two Volunteer Companies for Active Service
                    were raised and sent out to South Africa from the Volunteer Battalions in
                    Lincolnshire, recruiting for the whole force was greatly stimulated and in 1900
                    the 1st Volunteer Battalion composed of eleven Companies in the City of
                        <placeName key="Lincoln, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q180057" xml:id="place4">Lincoln</placeName> and northern area of the
                    County was greatly above its establishment, and was redistributed to form two 8

                <p>This organization continued until 1908, when only two Infantry Battalions of the
                    Territorial Force were required in place of the three Volunteer Battalions.
                    After much discussion it was decided by the County Association to raise the 4th
                    Territorial Battalion from the City of <placeName key="Lincoln, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q180057" xml:id="place8">Lincoln</placeName> and <placeName key="Horncastle, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1628403" xml:id="place9">Horncastle</placeName>

                <p>It is interesting to note the widely different character of the population in the
                    various districts. The <placeName key="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q179406" xml:id="place18">Grimsby</placeName> recruits
                    were chiefly drawn from men <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/3/mode/1up" xml:id="p3"/> employed in the
                    fishing industry and in the docks; <placeName key="Louth, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1554129" xml:id="place19">Louth</placeName>, <placeName key="Spilsby, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q745175" xml:id="place20">Spilsby</placeName>, and

                    mechanics employed in the Engineering works; <placeName key="Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q913386" xml:id="place23">Scunthorpe</placeName> recruited from the sturdy workers in the iron-stone
                    and smelting industries, and from agricultural workers in the <placeName key="Brigg, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2058702" xml:id="place24">Brigg</placeName> district; <placeName key="Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q24306292" xml:id="place25">Barton-on-Humber</placeName> provided recruits chiefly from the mechanics
                    in the cycle works, of a type similar to those of <placeName key="Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q288082" xml:id="place26">Gainsborough</placeName>. This great diversity of civil occupation proved
                    of immense advantage on mobilization, as the necessary skilled men were
                    comparatively easily obtained for all the &quot;specialist&quot; duties
                    required.</p>

                    In a country battalion, recruiting from a wide and comparatively sparsely
                    populated area, as this battalion was, the raising and training of the various
                    companies depended very largely on the local officers commanding them; the
                    Battalion, as such, only assembled at the Annual Training in Camp, and much
                    initiative and hard work was required and, to their great credit, usually
                    obtained from the Company Officers during the years preceding mobilization.</p>
                <p>In view of the more stringent regulations with regard to efficiency in the
                    newly-constituted Territorial Force compared with those of the old Volunteers,
                    and the consequent diminution in numbers which acceptance of the new conditions
                        <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/4/mode/1up" xml:id="p4"/> involved, it was thought desirable to
                    attempt to popularize the new Service and stimulate recruiting by holding the
                    annual camp for Battalion training at a seaside resort, if possible within the
                    Battalion's recruiting area. Accordingly in 1908 the annual training took place
                    at <placeName key="Skegness, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q977991" xml:id="place27">Skegness</placeName>, the period of training
                    being now fourteen days, in place of seven days formerly required of the
                    Volunteers as a maximum. It was speedily found, however, that although in
                    Companies like <placeName key="Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q288082" xml:id="place28">Gainsborough</placeName> and
                        <placeName key="Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q913386" xml:id="place29">Scunthorpe</placeName>, where the great majority
                    of the men were employed in works, which closed for a fourteen days' holiday,
                    the greater proportion of the men could and did undergo the full period of
                    training, in the Companies recruited from the agricultural areas it was not
                    possible to get the majority of the men to perform more than seven days'
                    continuous training in Camp. These conditions continued in subsequent years, and
                    the efficiency of the Battalion suffered in consequence. During the drill
                    season, recruit drills, company drills, musketry training, range practices and
                    all work that could be performed at Company Headquarters, were carried out
                    without much difficulty, and the results were satisfactory as far as they went,
                    but the time for Battalion training, accustoming the Companies to work with each
                    other, and above all for the inculcation of discipline, as understood in the
                    Service, was far too short to allow of any really satisfactory result, although
                    slow but steady improvement was attained year by year. The standard of conduct
                    in the individual in the Battalion was high, very high; the keenness, the
                    enthusiasm, the desire to learn their work, and the general willingness of the
                    men to obey commands was noteworthy; but the unquestioning obedience, the
                    automatic response to an order, the unbreakable chain of responsibility, <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/5/mode/1up" xml:id="p5"/> the high morale, the sense of comradeship and
                    esprit de corps, which exist as a matter of course in a highly disciplined
                    Battalion, only existed, as in the Territorial Force generally, in outline. How
                    that outline was worthily filled up in 1914 and the following years, will be
                    seen in the subsequent history of the Battalion.</p>
                <p>The Annual Training at <placeName key="Skegness, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q977991" xml:id="place30">Skegness</placeName> in 1908
                    was not of a very arduous character, and every effort was made to render
                    training in Camp attractive and popular. Much good work was done however,
                    Company and Battalion drill were assiduously practised, the elements of
                    manoeuvre were learnt, and the general standard of efficiency at the end of
                    fourteen days was notably improved.</p>

                <p>The Annual Training in 1909 took place at <placeName key="Garendon Park, Leicestershire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15221411" xml:id="place33">Garendon Park</placeName>, Leicestershire, where the newly-formed Lincoln and
                    Leicester Brigade was brought together for the first time under the command of
                    the Brigadier, <persName key="Carthew-Yorstoun, A M, Col" xml:id="pers62"><roleName type="military">Col.</roleName>

                            <surname>Carthew-Yorstoun</surname></persName>. The training was of the
                    usual nature, chiefly Company and Battalion work, with two days of combined
                    Brigade training. The weather was very fine, hot and dry, and a serious heath
                    fire occurred in the neighbourhood, which the Battalion assisted to subdue; in
                    recognition of their services, the owner of the property forwarded a cheque for
                    £50 to Battalion Funds.</p>
                <p>In 1910, the Annual Training was carried out at <placeName key="Buxton, Derbyshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q971223" xml:id="place34">Buxton</placeName>, where a Brigade Camp was again formed, and more
                    extended Brigade and Battalion manoeuvre <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/6/mode/1up" xml:id="p6"/> was
                    practised than in the previous year, as a large stretch of open land was
                    available. Unfortunately, the weather this year was very bad during the greater
                    part of the time, and seriously interfered with the training programme.</p>
                <p>In 1911 the Battalion again performed their Annual Training in a Brigade Camp at
                        <placeName key="Garendon Park, Leicestershire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15221411" xml:id="place35">Garendon Park</placeName> under favourable

                    end at the termination of this training. The Battalion owes much to him; an
                    excellent instructor, he devoted himself most loyally to promote efficiency in
                    every way, especially in musketry, and his efforts were rewarded by a steady
                    yearly improvement. He was succeeded by <persName key="Richardson, J F, Capt" xml:id="pers64"><roleName type="military">Captain</roleName>

                    Divisional Training was very elementary but extremely valuable, enabling units
                    of different Arms to obtain a rough idea of how to <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/7/mode/1up" xml:id="p7"/> work together, and affording an opportunity for Infantry to
                    watch the work of other Arms, especially Artillery. Owing to the long marches
                    necessary in Divisional operations the training was strenuous and exhausting,
                    but all ranks worked well, and the Divisional Commander was very satisfied with
                    the result.</p>

                <p>In 1913, in contrast to Divisional training of the previous year, it was thought
                    desirable to carry out the Annual Training of the Infantry in Battalion Camps,
                    in order to give an opportunity of carefully supervising the elementary training
                    of sections and companies, especially in musketry and fire control, together
                    with Company and Battalion Drill, while manoeuvre was limited to inter-company
                    schemes. The ground selected, Stoke Rochfort Park, near <placeName key="Grantham, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q846683" xml:id="place41">Grantham</placeName>, was admirably suited for the purpose,
                    the weather good, and the benefit of careful training of subordinate commanders
                    at the Camp was clearly felt in the following year. With the exception of one
                    day's inspection by the Divisional Commander, the training was entirely in the

                    week was rudely interrupted by the outbreak of the Great War.</p>
                <p>The Battalion in the summer of 1914 was considerably below establishment both in
                    officers and other ranks; recruiting then, as always, was slow and difficult; a
                    large number of the old Volunteers, who joined the Territorial Force on its
                    formation and served for four years, had not renewed their engagement, finding
                    themselves unable to fulfil the required conditions for efficiency in the
                    Territorial Force. On the other hand the standard of efficiency and military
                    knowledge had been gradually and slowly raised during the past six years,
                    although still falling far short of that at which we aimed. A good Machine Gun
                    Section had been formed and trained by <persName key="Dixon, Oscar, Capt" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/1648136" xml:id="pers76"><roleName type="military">Lieut.</roleName>

                <p>On <date when="1914-07-25">July 25th, 1914</date>, the two Lincolnshire
                    Battalions assembled at <placeName key="Bridlington, Yorkshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q527391" xml:id="place43">Bridlington</placeName>, and
                    carried out the usual training for a week, being joined on <date when="1914-08-02">August 2nd</date> (Sunday) by the Leicestershire
                    Battalions to complete the Brigade. On that day, however, it became known that,
                    owing to the threatening political situation and the imminent risk of war, the
                    training would be interrupted and orders were subsequently received for all
                    Battalions to return to their Headquarters next day. On <date when="1914-08-03">Monday evening, August 3rd</date>, the Battalion left camp and marched to
                        <placeName key="Bridlington, Yorkshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q527391" xml:id="place44">Bridlington</placeName> station, the first half
                    Battalion leaving at once, and reaching their various stations next morning; the
                    train for the second half, however, <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/9/mode/1up" xml:id="p9"/> was many
                    hours late, and did not leave till 9 a.m. on <date when="1914-08-04">Tuesday,

                    until late in the afternoon. Thus ended the Peace Training of <date when="1914">1914</date>; next day, <date when="1914-08-05">Wednesday, August
                    5th</date>, the Battalion was mobilized for War.</p>

                    dismissed with orders to hold themselves in readiness to assemble at their Drill
                    Halls directly the hourly-expected order to mobilize was received. The
                    preparation of the necessary detailed orders for Mobilization, and their careful
                    revision from time to time, had been the anxious care of the Commanding Officers
                    and Adjutants for several years. In the Spring of <date when="1914">1914</date>
                    they were finally revised and approved by the Brigade and Divisional Commanders,
                    and a printed copy was supplied as a confidential document to all Officers who
                    were thus acquainted in minute detail with procedure and duties required. At
                    8.42 p.m. on <date when="1914-08-04">August 4th</date>, in accordance with a
                    telegraphic order from Headquarters, Lincoln and Leicester Brigade, the laconic
                    telegram &quot;Rapid Mobilization&quot; was despatched to all Officers
                    from Battalion Headquarters at <placeName key="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q179406" xml:id="place45">Grimsby</placeName>.
                    The response was excellent, and although <date when="1914-08-05">Wednesday,
                        August 5th</date>, was the first official day of mobilization, several
                    Companies had already reassembled on <date when="1914-08-04">Tuesday</date>
                    night at their Drill Halls, and early on <date when="1914-08-05">Wednesday</date> morning, every Company was busily engaged in the work laid
                    down for the first day, medical inspection, provision of necessaries, purchase
                    of articles to complete deficiencies of kits, and careful inspection of arms and

                    Doughty Road. From the first day the mobilization arrangements of this Battalion
                    were very seriously hampered by the fact that whereas Territorial Battalions
                    generally, including all others in the North Midland Division, were able to
                    devote the whole of their time and energy to the procedure of mobilization, we
                    at <placeName key="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q179406" xml:id="place48">Grimsby</placeName> were called upon at once for
                    active guard duties for the docks and harbour, as protection was absolutely
                    essential for the harbour, the electric power station, the wireless station at
                        <placeName xml:id="place49">Weelsby</placeName>, and so on, and the only
                    available military force was the Battalion. The strength of the Battalion on

                    mobilization was 24 Officers and 780 Other Ranks.</p>
                <p>On <date when="1914-08-07">Friday, August 7th</date>, with the exception of the
                    detachment on guard at the <placeName xml:id="place51">Weelsby</placeName>
                    wireless station the whole Battalion was employed in placing the docks in a
                    state of defence, barricading piers, and digging shelter trenches on the beach
                    at the mouth of the Humber at <placeName key="Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q587765" xml:id="place52">Cleethorpes</placeName>, while plans had to be prepared to occupy the defences
                    in case of attack.</p>
                <p>At 3 a.m. on <date when="1914-08-08">Saturday, August 8th</date>, an alarm was
                    given and orders were received from the Officer Commanding the Humber Defences,
                    in view of a possible hostile raid, to occupy the positions prepared for the
                    defence, and this was done at once. During the day the work of improving the
                    defences was <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/12/mode/1up" xml:id="p12"/> continued and the next night was
                    spent with the Battalion occupying their defence stations, Battalion
                    Headquarters being established on board one of the Grimsby and Hook of Holland
                    Line vessels, <name>S.S. Dewsbury</name>, in the docks.</p>
                <p>On <date when="1914-08-09">Sunday, August 9th</date>, the strain was relaxed, the
                    Battalion was permitted to return to billets and we were able to devote
                    ourselves to the necessary duties in connection with mobilization proper, and on
                        <date when="1914-08-10">Monday, August 10th</date>, the <rs key="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115592757" type="person" xml:id="pers792">Commanding
                        Officer</rs> was able to report to Brigade Headquarters according to the
                    pre-arranged plan that mobilization was complete, and the Battalion ready to
                    move to its war station. The fact that this was possible, in spite of the
                    manifold extra duties performed, as has been shown, speaks volumes for the
                    keenness, energy, and enthusiasm of all ranks. The Colours of the Battalion were
                    escorted to the Parish Church at <placeName key="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q179406" xml:id="place53">Grimsby</placeName>
                    with due ceremony, and handed to the <rs key="Markham, Algernon Augustus, Canon" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4724161" type="person" xml:id="pers793">Vicar</rs> for safe custody.</p>
                <p>The provision of the Battalion Transport necessary on mobilization was one of the
                    most difficult duties, involving the collection and purchase of the waggons,
                    carts, horses, harness and equipment required, as well as selection of suitable
                    personnel. The Transport Officer, <persName key="Finnie, Bertram Knott, Capt (d 1915)" ref="https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/1612364/" xml:id="pers78"><roleName type="military">Lieut.</roleName>

                    very difficult task. In spite of many difficulties and occasional humourous
                    catastrophies the vehicles were obtained, a very heterogeneous collection it is
                    true, consisting of lorries and brewery waggons for four wheeled, and fish carts
                    for two wheeled, carriages. The horses were also a somewhat miscellaneous
                    collection, and the harness kaleideoscopic in character, but still by the fifth
                    day of mobilization, according to plan, the <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/13/mode/1up" xml:id="p13"/>
                    Transport was complete, the horses branded and shod, and personnel with a
                    knowledge of their duties obtained, thus forming an effective and useful, if not
                    ornamental, Detail of the Battalion.</p>

                    the men, who had had a very hard week's work with very little sleep, and the
                    numbers who were compelled to fall out were uncomfortably large, and gave an
                    indication of the physical unfitness of many for immediate active service.</p>

                    <surname>Strutt</surname></persName> welcomed the Brigade and Battalion Staffs
                    as their guests. The four Battalions of the Brigade were concentrated at

                    next few days the training consisted of route marches of gradually increasing
                    length in full marching order with the object of hardening and improving the
                    physical fitness of all ranks.</p>
                <p>On <date when="1914-08-15">Saturday, August 15th</date>, the Battalion left

                    the order to be at the entraining station one hour before the time fixed for the
                    departure of the train, which was 7 p.m. Owing, however, to the dislocation of
                    the train service by the entraining of the whole Division, we were kept waiting
                    till 11.30 p.m., finally leaving at midnight <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/14/mode/1up" xml:id="p14"/>
                    for <placeName key="Leagrave, Luton, Bedfordshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q986066" xml:id="place64">Leagrave</placeName> Station, three miles from

                    the Division for the next three months.</p>
                <p>The Battalion was billeted at <placeName key="Luton, Bedfordshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q203889" xml:id="place66">Luton</placeName> under
                    various conditions, some Companies in factories, others in empty houses, while a
                    certain proportion of men, to their great delight, were fortunate enough to be
                    billeted in private houses. Battalion Headquarters with Orderly Room and
                    Officers' Mess were established in an empty house in the Biscot Road. During the
                    next week all units settled down to steady training, beginning at 7 a.m. and
                    ending at 4 p.m. daily, and on the <date when="1914-08-22">22nd</date> a
                    Divisional concentration march was practised for the first time. Naturally many
                    mistakes occurred, and the criticism of the <rs key="Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3048565" type="person" xml:id="pers794">

                    themselves not merely as units but as factors in the North Midland Division.</p>
                <p>The question of volunteering for active service abroad had first been mooted at
                        <placeName key="Belper, Derbyshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2080375" xml:id="place67">Belper</placeName>, when the response was rather
                    half-hearted, to the great disappointment of the officers, but the numbers
                    rapidly improved, and during the next week, some 650 men having volunteered, the
                    Battalion was accepted as a unit for foreign service, as was the whole Division.
                    Recruiting was now very brisk, and on <date when="1914-08-31">August 31st</date>
                    the Division was reorganized for foreign service, those men who felt themselves
                    unable to volunteer being billeted and trained separately, ultimately being
                    stationed at <placeName key="Dunstable, Bedfordshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q919778" xml:id="place68">Dunstable</placeName> under <persName key="Marshall, H D, Maj" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/2932409" xml:id="pers81"><roleName type="military">Major</roleName>

                    Reserve Battalion.</p>
                <p>The newly-organized Foreign Service Battalion was rapidly recruited up to
                    establishment, but uniform, arms and equipment were lacking, and were only
                    obtained gradually, the demands not being fully supplied for nearly two months.
                    It is not <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/15/mode/1up" xml:id="p15"/> necessary to describe in detail the
                    training for the next two months; it is sufficient to say that it was strenuous
                    and thorough. The work was varied by occasional Divisional Field days, and night
                    operations were practised at least twice a week. As a rule Battalions with Band
                    and Drums marched out in Brigade to the training area, which was of satisfactory
                    extent, each Battalion there carrying out the day's programme of work, returning
                    to billets again in Brigade; usually a haversack ration was carried, but
                    frequently dinners were cooked in the field. Musketry for recruits was carried
                    out on the Dunstable range, while a special range was constructed on Wardown
                    Hill for trained men. Field firing was practised on a special range at
                        <placeName key="Dunstable, Bedfordshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q919778" xml:id="place69">Dunstable</placeName>. On Sundays a ceremonial
                    Church Parade was usually held.</p>
                <p>During the first week in <date when="1914-09">September</date> the training
                    programme had to be considerably modified for some days on account of
                    anti-typhoid inoculation, which, necessary as it was realised to be, was very
                    unpopular and incapacitated men for a few days, but this was quickly forgotten,
                    and the prospect of Service in the Field being nearer, every branch of training
                    was resumed with added energy and enthusiasm.</p>
                <p>On <date when="1914-09-29">September 29th</date>, the Division was inspected in
                        Luton Hoo Park by <persName key="Kitchener, Horatio Herbert, Earl" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q216129" xml:id="pers82">

                        <surname>Kitchener</surname></persName>, who informed the Divisional Commander that the Division would be
                    sent abroad as soon as the Reserve Battalions were recruited up to full
                    strength, and on <date when="1914-10-17">October 17th</date> orders were
                    received for the Division to hold itself in readiness for Foreign Service by
                        <date when="1914-10-31">October 31st</date>. There was naturally much
                    excitement and every man was given 48 hours' final leave during the next week.
                    Training, however, was continued steadily, the looked-for date came and passed
                    and <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/16/mode/1up" xml:id="p16"/> many fanciful rumours circulated, but no
                    order was received until midnight of <date when="1914-11-15">Sunday, November
                        15th</date>, when the Battalion was instructed to parade at 7.30 a.m. next
                    morning to act as baggage guard to the Division. Our first destination was
                        <placeName key="Ware, Hertfordshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q19792" xml:id="place71">Ware</placeName> in Hertfordshire and the march
                    of 28 miles was a very severe test of endurance, but most satisfactorily
                    performed by the Battalion, which arrived tired but cheerful at 7.30 p.m. It is
                    of interest to note that this march was fully described in a special article in
                    the Times with much friendly comment and kindly criticism, the name of the
                    Division being of course withheld. On the <date when="1914-11-16">next
                    day</date> the Battalion rested in billets, and on <date when="1914-11-18">November 18th</date> marched to <placeName key="Stansted, Essex, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q126579" xml:id="place72">Stansted</placeName> in Essex, three miles from <placeName key="Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q33789942" xml:id="place73">Bishop's Stortford</placeName>, where Brigade and Divisional Headquarters

                    various orders to move, always countermanded within a few hours, the Battalion
                    remained in comfortable billets until the Division went abroad. For the first
                    three weeks there was ample room, but on <date when="1914-12-09">December

                    admirable battalion training ground, and training was steadily continued. The

                    had been very fine on the whole; afterwards the programme was constantly
                    interfered with by bad weather. Brigade and Divisional Field days were only held
                    very occasionally, attention being devoted principally to Company and Battalion
                    work and musketry, varied by special practices in entraining, bridging,
                    entrenching, and so on. The week before Christmas some 400 men returned to Luton
                    to complete their musketry course, coming back on <date when="1914-12-23">December 23rd</date>.</p>
                <p>The fact that no Christmas leave was given was at first a disappointment to many
                    men, but was accepted <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/17/mode/1up" xml:id="p17"/> cheerfully as a
                    compliment when it was explained that the Territorial Divisions were at the time
                    the only trained troops available in case of invasion, the New Armies not being
                    yet fit for immediate service. During Christmas week the invasion scare was at
                    its height, and we received orders to be ready to move at any minute. In these
                    circumstances Christmas was celebrated in the usual fashion, with a holiday on
                        <date when="1914-12-25">Christmas day</date> and <date when="1914-12-26">Boxing day</date>. Company dinners were held, an inter-Company football
                    competition was carried through and a generally enjoyable time was spent, and
                    then hard work began again.</p>
                <p>On <date when="1915-01-01">January 1st, 1915</date>, the new four-company
                    Battalion organization was adopted, and the next few weeks were devoted
                    principally to Platoon, Company, and Battalion Drill. On <date when="1915-01-05">January 5th</date>, the Battalion went to <placeName key="Dunstable, Bedfordshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q919778" xml:id="place77">Dunstable</placeName> for three days for practice in Field Firing, with the
                    exception of the recruits, who in their turn went to <placeName key="Luton, Bedfordshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q203889" xml:id="place78">Luton</placeName> on the <date when="1915-01-09">9th</date> to complete
                    their necessary training, returning on the <date when="1915-01-15">15th</date>.
                    The anxiously-awaited orders for Foreign Service were still delayed but at last
                    on <date when="1915-02-15">February 15th</date> a definite warning order was
                    issued, stating that the Division was to be ready to go abroad at short notice,
                    probably on the <date when="1915-02-23">23rd</date>, and all leave was
                    cancelled.</p>
                <p>On <date when="1915-02-19">February 19th</date>, to the gratification of all
                    ranks, the Division was inspected in <placeName key="Great Hallingbury, Essex, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q126573" xml:id="place79">Hallingbury</placeName> Park by <rs key="George V, King" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q269412" type="person" xml:id="pers795">H.M. the King</rs>; a special complimentary order was
                    subsequently issued expressing His Majesty's pleasure at seeing the Division,
                    and wishing it God-Speed.</p>
                <p>The next week was one of feverish excitement, tempered by the expenditure of much
                    energy, and very hard work. Clothing, boots, arms, and equipment were very
                    thoroughly inspected, and all deficiencies replaced. The Machine Guns were <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/18/mode/1up" xml:id="p18"/> converted to take Mark vii. ammunition. Our
                    heterogeneous collection of lorries, carts, and harness constituting the
                    Transport had been scrapped, and regulation waggons and limbers, with the
                    necessary harness, supplied, the careful fitting of the latter being a matter of
                    supreme importance. <persName key="Taylor, A W M, Brig-Gen" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/5408390" xml:id="pers83">

                <p>The Battalion was now completely at war strength in Officers and Other Ranks,
                    thoroughly equipped, although only armed with the old long rifle, well trained
                    and physically fit as regards personnel, with the Transport in good condition.
                    The Machine Gun and Signalling Sections had been carefully trained, and were
                    very efficient, and all ranks looked forward with a cheery confidence to Active
                    Service in the Field.</p>

                <head>Early Days in France</head>
                <p>At 11 p.m. on <date when="1915-02-26">Friday, February 26th, 1915</date>, the
                    Battalion paraded for the last time in England, and marched to <placeName key="Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q33789942" xml:id="place80">Bishop's Stortford</placeName> station where they entrained
                    for <placeName key="Southampton, Hampshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q79848" xml:id="place81">Southampton</placeName> on their way to the
                    Front. The departure from <placeName key="Stansted, Essex, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q126579" xml:id="place82">Stansted</placeName> of
                    the Battalion headed by the band, which had been selected to accompany the
                    Lincoln and Leicester Brigade as the Brigade band, was witnessed, despite the
                    late hour, by large numbers of the inhabitants, and was a scene of great
                    enthusiasm. All ranks were in the highest spirits, confident in themselves,
                    eager to prove themselves in the Field, proud to belong to the first Territorial
                    Division to proceed as such, to France. The three miles march to <placeName key="Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q33789942" xml:id="place83">Bishop's Stortford</placeName> completed, the Battalion
                    entrained without a hitch, arriving at <placeName key="Southampton, Hampshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q79848" xml:id="place84">Southampton</placeName> Docks at 7 a.m. on <date when="1915-02-27">February
                        27th</date>. The Transport and 200 men proceeded to a Rest Camp, while the
                    remainder waited in the Docks till 3 p.m., when they embarked on the <name>S.S.
                        Empress Queen</name>, with various other details, and left the Harbour at 10
                    p.m. for <placeName key="Le Havre, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q42810" xml:id="place85">Havre</placeName>. The passage was
                    uneventful and fairly smooth and was completed at 4 a.m. on the <date when="1915-02-28">28th</date>, but many of the men had never been at sea
                    before and a considerable number fell victims to sea-sickness. At 8 a.m.
                    disembarkation began, under the superintendence of <persName key="Sleight, Ernest, Maj" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/4072429" xml:id="pers85"><roleName type="military">Major</roleName>
                        <forename full="init">E</forename>. <surname>Sleight</surname></persName>,
                    who had proceeded to <placeName key="Le Havre, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q42810" xml:id="place86">Havre</placeName> some days
                    previously to act as Assistant Military Landing Officer to the Division. A march
                    of four <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/20/mode/1up" xml:id="p20"/> miles to the Rest Camp, on the heights
                    between <placeName key="Le Havre, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q42810" xml:id="place87">Havre</placeName> and <placeName key="Le Havre, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q42810" xml:id="place88">Harfleur</placeName>, overlooking the estuary of the Seine
                    followed, and the Battalion found themselves under canvas for the first time
                    since mobilization. The contrast between tents on the wind-swept heights of
                    Normandy in bitterly cold weather in February and the training camp under a hot
                    July sun on the Yorkshire coast at <placeName key="Bridlington, Yorkshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q527391" xml:id="place89">Bridlington</placeName> can better be imagined than described. Under these
                    conditions the Battalion proceeded to make themselves as comfortable as
                    circumstances permitted to await the arrival of the Transport and the detachment
                    left at <placeName key="Southampton, Hampshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q79848" xml:id="place90">Southampton</placeName>, and for several
                    days they waited in vain. A route march of six miles was undertaken daily to
                    keep the men fit and a certain amount of instruction given by means of lectures;
                    goat-skin trench-coats were issued to the great delight of the recipients, the
                    more welcome as the ground was covered with snow, which remained, where not
                    churned up into mud, until our departure. On <date when="1915-03-02">March
                    2nd</date> two Platoons were detailed as an advanced-party and left by train for
                    their destination, and at length on the <date when="1915-03-04">4th</date> the
                    anxiously-awaited Transport arrived, and the Battalion left the Rest Camp at 9
                    p.m. to join them at the Gare de Merchandise at <placeName key="Le Havre, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q42810" xml:id="place91">Havre</placeName>. The first entrainment with French rolling stock was
                    rather a slow performance, owing to inexperience, but was completed in good time
                    for the departure of the train at 2.15 a.m. on <date when="1915-03-05">March
                    5th</date>. The long railway journey at the pace of a French train in war time
                    was a novel experience. <placeName key="Monterolier, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q750544" xml:id="place92">Monterolier-Buchy</placeName>, where boiling water was ready to make tea, was
                    reached at 7 a.m. and <placeName key="Abbeville, Somme, Picardie, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q28520" xml:id="place93">Abbeville</placeName> at 2.30
                    p.m. with many wayside halts, passing <placeName key="Boulogne-sur-Mer, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q81997" xml:id="place94">Boulogne</placeName> and <placeName key="Calais, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6454" xml:id="place95">Calais</placeName>:
                        <placeName key="Saint-Omer, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q208793" xml:id="place96">St. Omer</placeName>, then the Headquarters of
                    the British Army, was reached at 8.30 p.m. and our final destination, <placeName key="Arneke, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q598283" xml:id="place97">Arneke</placeName>, <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/21/mode/1up" xml:id="p21"/> near
                        <placeName key="Hazebrouck, Nord, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11131" xml:id="place98">Haazebrouk</placeName>, which had only been
                    notified at <placeName key="Saint-Omer, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q208793" xml:id="place99">St. Omer</placeName>, at 11 p.m. The
                    Battalion was to experience many such journeys in the future, but this first
                    slow progress towards the Front in the unfamiliar French
                    &quot;wagons&quot;, each carrying 40 men, made an indelible impression
                    on the minds of those who made it.</p>
                <p>The Battalion detrained most satisfactorily by the unaccustomed light of flares,
                    found temporary billets near the station for the night, and marched at 9 a.m.
                    next morning to <placeName key="Zermezeele, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1152274" xml:id="place100">Zermazeele</placeName> and
                        <placeName key="Wemaers-Cappel, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q638069" xml:id="place101">Weimar's Cappel</placeName>, where they
                    remained in scattered billets for the next three days, the time being occupied
                    in Platoon training, while the Signal Section distinguished themselves by their
                    first effort at communication in the Field, running up temporary but efficient
                    telephone communication between Battalion Headquarters at <placeName key="Wemaers-Cappel, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q638069" xml:id="place102">Weimar's Cappel</placeName> Chateau and the various
                    Company Headquarters in the villages. The other Battalions of the Lincoln and
                    Leicester Brigade were billeted in the neighbouring villages, and on <date when="1915-03-09">March 9th</date> the Brigade concentrated, and marched
                    through <placeName key="Cassel, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q207145" xml:id="place103">Cassel</placeName>, passing the
                    Headquarters of the French Army under <persName key="Foch, Ferdinand, Marshal" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q192615" xml:id="pers86">

                        <surname>Foch</surname></persName>, the band playing and the usual compliments being paid; then on
                    through <placeName key="Caestre, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q545556" xml:id="place104">Caestre</placeName>, where they were
                    inspected on the march by <persName key="Smith-Dorrien, Horace Lockwood, Gen" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q532574" xml:id="pers87">

                        <surname>Smith-Dorien</surname></persName>, under whose command the North Midland Division was then placed, to
                        <placeName key="Strazeele, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1160742" xml:id="place105">Strazeele</placeName> near <placeName key="Bailleul, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q332310" xml:id="place106">Bailleul</placeName>, where good billets were found.</p>
                <p>At <placeName key="Strazeele, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1160742" xml:id="place107">Strazeele</placeName>, the Battalion remained for
                    two days, under orders to be ready to march at short notice. Excitement ran high
                    as the Division was known to be detailed as Army Reserve during the Battle of
                        <placeName key="Neuve-Chapelle, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1025314" xml:id="place108">Neuve Chapelle</placeName>, from which so much
                    was expected; visions presented themselves of the Battalion coming into action
                    for the first time in &quot;open warfare&quot; <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/22/mode/1up" xml:id="p22"/> instead of in trenches, as a consequence of the hoped for
                    break through in the German line. All ranks were directed to remain near their
                    billets, but horses must be exercised, and by an evil chance the orders to move
                    at 11.45 a.m. was received at 10.55 a.m., when all the Transport animals were
                    out at exercise. As a consequence the fulfilment of the order was impossible and
                    it was not until 1.40 p.m. that the Brigade was formed up to march to <placeName key="Sailly-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q877819" xml:id="place109">Sailly-sur-Lys</placeName>, the displeasure of the <rs key="Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3048565" type="person" xml:id="pers796">Divisional

                    heard, was very trying and tedious, with many halts, and the Battalion at length
                    arrived at <placeName key="Sailly-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q877819" xml:id="place110">Sailly</placeName> at 8.45 p.m., the

                    accomodation, and the only shelter available for some 250 men was beneath the
                    transport vehicles, which were parked in the streets.</p>

                    billets being gradually found for everyone, but the hope of coming into action,
                    slowly faded as the days passed and on the <date when="1915-03-14">14th</date>
                    and <date when="1915-03-15">15th</date> the orders were varied, viz., to be
                    ready to move at two hours' notice, and a certain amount of Platoon training was
                    carried out to occupy the time. At length it was realised, although a part of
                    the Divisional Artillery came into action, that the Infantry would not have the
                    opportunity of taking part in the battle of <placeName key="Neuve-Chapelle, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1025314" xml:id="place112">Neuve-Chappelle</placeName>, and on the <date when="1915-03-16">

                        <placeName key="Steenwerck, Nord, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q679993" xml:id="place114">Steenwercke</placeName>, about three miles
                    south of <placeName key="Bailleul, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q332310" xml:id="place115">Bailleul</placeName>, and settled down
                    into comfortable billets, and for the next week the time was occupied by route
                    marches, Company training, Platoon training, instruction in trench construction,
                    and the usual interior economy and routine of a Battalion behind the lines in
                    the early days before the era of laundries and divisional baths. The billets at
                        <placeName key="Steenwerck, Nord, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q679993" xml:id="place116">Steenwercke</placeName> were more or less
                    typical of those occupied in Northern France on many subsequent occasions; they
                    have often been described but in order to appreciate the surroundings of the
                    Battalion when not in the front line, it must be remembered that the men of a
                    Company were usually billeted in the barns and out-buildings surrounding the
                    farm house in which the Company Officers could find accommodation, the centre of
                    the yard being invariably occupied by a gigantic manure heap, to the great
                    discomfiture of the British Sanitary Service, who entirely failed, then and
                    afterwards, to convince the inhabitants that this was detrimental to health,
                    even though the sole water supply was obtained from a well in a corner within a
                    few feet of the oderiferous mound. In the early days straw was usually easily
                    obtained on payment and the Officers generally provided it for their men. For
                    bathing large tubs could usually be borrowed; when these were not available a
                    large hole was dug in a neighbouring field, lined with a tarpaulin sheet from a
                    transport waggon and a very useful, if primitive, bath provided: hot water was
                    obtained from the Battalion cookers. Clothes were washed as and when opportunity
                    offered and dried on the grass or hedge rows. Battalion Headquarters were <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/24/mode/1up" xml:id="p24"/> generally in a similar farm or house in the
                    village, while the Transport was parked and horses picketed on the nearest
                    suitable ground.</p>
                <p>During the next fortnight, the Division was sent up to the Line in relays of
                    Battalions for instruction in trench duties. The turn of the 5th Lincolnshire
                    arrived on <date when="1915-03-26">March 26th</date>, when the Battalion moved
                    to Oosthoove Farm, a large pile of buildings near <placeName key="Ploegsteert, Comines, Belgium" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2351222" xml:id="place117">Ploegsteert</placeName>, known to the Army as Plug Street, which
                    accommodated the whole Battalion while attached to the 11th Infantry Brigade,
                    then holding the line in this sector. One Company proceeded to trenches each
                    night for attachment to a Company of the 2nd East Lancashire Regiment who
                    occupied a line on the edge of <placeName key="Ploegsteert, Comines, Belgium" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2351222" xml:id="place118">Ploegsteert</placeName> Wood, being relieved by another Company after 24 hours'
                    duty. During this preliminary tour, when much valuable experience was gained,
                    the first casualties were suffered, one <choice>

                    spent, during which instruction was given in bombs and bomb-throwing, then a
                    complete novelty. The conversion of the Machine Guns for Mark vii. ammunition
                    had been found very defective during the tour in the <placeName key="Ploegsteert, Comines, Belgium" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2351222" xml:id="place120">Ploegsteert</placeName> sector, and the necessary

                    preparatory to taking over a line of trenches on the <date when="1915-04-08">8th</date>. During these three days the Officers were sent up to make
                    themselves acquainted with the trenches to be held, and on the evening of <date when="1915-04-08"><corr>April</corr> 8th</date>, the Battalion relieved the
                    4th Leicestershire Regiment who had taken over the trenches four days
                    previously. The relief, owing to the inexperience of both Battalions, was a
                    lengthy proceeding, and was not completed until nearly 3 a.m., when the
                    Battalion realised the first of its ambitions and took its place as a
                    responsible unit holding a sector of the line.</p>
                <p>The position held was an unfavourable one, facing the <placeName key="Mesen, Belgium" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q737077" xml:id="place126">Messines</placeName>-<placeName key="Wijtschate, Heuvelland, Belgium" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2174414" xml:id="place127">Wychaete</placeName> Ridge, the German trenches being on higher ground, and to
                    a great extent commanding a view over our own. The &quot;trenches&quot;
                    here were really breastworks only, built of sandbags with very little depth of
                    excavated trench—sometimes with none. The one communication trench was shallow,
                    practically undrained, very wet and only used by day, as by night ration parties
                    and reliefs preferred to move direct to the front line over the open to
                    struggling along a communication trench knee-deep in mud and water. The first
                    casualty to an officer occurred from this cause, when <persName key="Hadfield, James Henry, Maj" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/1510593" xml:id="pers89"><roleName type="military">Captain</roleName>

                    trenches after relief. The trenches were an irregular line roughly 200 yards
                    from the enemy's, but two trenches, E 1 Right and E 1 Left, were really isolated
                    posts <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/26/mode/1up" xml:id="p26"/> pushed forward close to the German Line,
                    E 1 Left only 25 yards from the enemy parapet, with no communication trench, so
                    that it could only be reached by night across the open, but this was remedied by
                    the construction of a communication trench within a few weeks. An intermittent
                    line of support trenches existed but these were shallow and neglected, with no
                    communication trenches to the front line, and therefore useless, and unoccupied.
                    The only real defensive positions behind the front line were two strong points,
                    which were garrisoned by half a Company. The Battalion was distributed with two
                    Companies holding the front line and strong points immediately in rear, while
                    two Companies were held in support in dug-outs about a mile behind, close to
                    Battalion Headquarters at One-Tree Farm. The tour in trenches was four days, the
                    Battalion and the 4th Leicester Regiment relieving each other alternately,
                    returning to rest in the same billets in <placeName key="Dranouter, Heuvelland, Belgium" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2117660" xml:id="place128">Dranoutre</placeName>. During the tours in trenches we worked very hard to
                    improve the position, draining the trenches, making the communication trenches
                    passable, strengthening parapets, constructing loop-holes and firing positions,
                    and building bomb-proof shelters; deep dug-outs were unknown in the Spring of
                    1915.</p>
                <p>In order to strengthen the defence, after the first tour in the trenches it was
                    arranged that all the machine guns of both Battalions should remain in position
                    in the trenches, and be manned in turn by detachments of machine gunners of the
                    Battalion in the line.</p>
                <p>This routine continued until <date when="1915-05-02">May 2nd</date>, when a
                    slight change was made in the distribution of the trenches allotted to the
                    Division and the Battalion &quot;side-slipped&quot; to the left,
                    Battalion Headquarters being moved to Lindenhoek Chateau about a mile <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/27/mode/1up" xml:id="p27"/>
                    north of their former position. On next relieving the 4th Leicestershire
                    Regiment on <date when="1915-05-10">May 10th</date> a further change was made in
                    distribution, one of the support Companies being moved forward to the newly
                    constructed &quot;Regent Street&quot; dug-outs under cover of a ridge
                    about 800 yards behind the front line.</p>
                <p>An important change in the nomenclature of the Division and Brigade took effect
                    on <date when="1915-05-12">May 12th</date>, when the titles of the North Midland
                    Division and Lincoln and Leicester Brigade were officially discarded and those
                    of the 46th Division and the 138th Brigade adopted in their place. At the same
                    time the official designation of the Battalion became the 1/5th Lincolnshire,
                    the Reserve Battalion in England being henceforth designated the 2/5th
                    Battalion, and the Reserve Division being known as the 59th Division.</p>
                <p>Casualties fortunately were few during the early days in the trenches, but on
                        <date when="1915-05-13">May 13th</date>

                    20th</date>, no event of particular importance occurred to break the monotony of
                    the usual trench warfare except that on <date when="1915-05-10">May 10th</date>
                    just as the Battalion reached Trench Headquarters, at One Tree Farm for the
                    usual relief of the 4th Leicestershire Regiment, a message was received that
                    Trench E 1 Left had been attacked and occupied by the enemy. The Battalion
                    immediately advanced in two lines of Companies in the darkness across the open
                    to support the Leicesters, but before the trench line was reached, information
                    was received that E 1 Left, which had been rushed by an enemy bombing party, had
                    been reoccupied without assistance; the relief was then completed in the usual
                    way. The sector held at this period was a very quiet one, shells were
                    comparatively rare visitors, practically <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/28/mode/1up" xml:id="p28"/> all
                    casualties being from rifle or machine gun fire. For some time, however,
                    suspicious sounds had been heard underground near Trench E 1 Left, garrisoned by
                    a platoon under an officer, and it was realised that the Germans were mining in
                    this direction and that the position was dangerous. On <date when="1915-05-20">May 20th</date> at 3 p.m. the mine was exploded under the parapet of the
                    trench, which was practically destroyed, many of the garrison being buried and
                    the remainder being killed or wounded. The <choice>

                    not return to their old billets, but bivouacked in fields on the Eastern slopes

                    as the ground dried, enabled the position to be greatly improved and
                    strengthened. An immense amount of work was done in strengthening parapets; the

                    communication with the front line was as easy by day as by night. The strong
                    points immediately in the rear of the front line were improved and a new one
                    constructed, and the Battalion had the satisfaction of knowing that they left

                    undertaken; for the next three days two Companies were detailed each day for

                    mile march to the trenches to be taken over from the 8th Sherwood Foresters in

The night was dark and wet, and
                    consequently the relief took some time, but was finally completed by 1.30 a.m.
                    on <date when="1915-06-30">June 30th</date>. In the afternoon of the same day
                    the Battalion was redistributed and further trenches taken over from the 4th
                    Royal Fusiliers, and the 1st Battalion of our own Regiment, these trenches being
                    situated in the <choice>

                    </choice> corner of Sanctuary Wood, with sheltered communications, which
                    rendered a daylight relief possible. Battalion Headquarters were in Sanctuary
                    Wood, and consisted only of a bomb-proof shelter, constantly exposed to shell
                    fire, and were moved <date when="1915-07-01">next day</date> to a more sheltered
                    spot in the wood, after one shell had exploded in the Headquarters' Mess Box,
                    which was placed just outside the door of the shelter, scattering its contents
                    in all directions; the Battalion staff showed no hesitation in complying with
                    the Brigade order to move. The distribution of Companies was also altered, one
                    Company being brought back to the new Battalion Headquarters in support, while
                    three Companies held the trench line. The only disadvantage of the position in
                    Sanctuary Wood was that no cooking was allowed by daylight; smoke at any point
                    invariably attracted shell fire to the spot. The most noticeable features in the
                    trench sector we now held were the comparative absence of rifle fire, with the
                    exception of long range machine gun fire at night, and the great increase in
                    artillery activity. In the <placeName key="Kemmel, Heuvelland, Belgium" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1024880" xml:id="place143">Kemmel</placeName>

                    our casualties in the trenches were practically all due to shell fire, those due
                    to rifle or machine-gun fire being sustained during reliefs when the troops were
                    in the open, and often a mile behind the front line. During this first tour in

                    that the tour of each Battalion in the trenches should be extended to six days,
                    instead of four as formerly, and except on emergency this routine was continued
                    for the future. Our relief was therefore fixed for the evening of <date when="1915-07-05">July 5th</date>, and was completed at 1.15 a.m. on <date when="1915-07-06">July 6th</date> by the 1/5th North Staffordshire Regiment,

                <p>During the next six day's rest, each Company carried out training independently
                    when not detailed, which was more often the case, for constructional work on
                    second line trenches at Kruisstraat or

                    to locate a sniper, who was annoying his trench. The weather now broke, and a
                    few days' heavy rain necessitated <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/35/mode/1up" xml:id="p35"/> much hard
                    work on repair and drainage of trenches and communication trenches. On <date when="1915-07-18">July 18th</date> yet another redistribution of front took
                    place, the Battalion frontage being prolonged to the left, and all four
                    Companies being brought up to the front line, with Battalion Headquarters in
                    dug-outs in a bank about 100 yards behind. At 11 p.m. on <date when="1915-07-19">July 19th</date> the Battalion was relieved by 1/4th Leicester Regiment and
                    returned to the dug-outs at the end of <placeName key="Zillebeke, Ieper, Belgium" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2337062" xml:id="place150">Zillebeke</placeName> Lake, as Brigade support, the Brigade front being now

                    Battalion was in Brigade support large working parties were detailed daily for
                    constructional work on second line trenches, and the remainder were occupied in

                    Companies, was totally insufficient for the whole Battalion. The great objection
                    to the Lake bank as a place of residence was the fact that the enemy artillery
                    had the range exactly and shelled continually, but fortunately the bank was very
                    narrow and shells fell either harmlessly in the lake itself, or on the marshy
                    ground on the other side, and did little damage; a direct hit on the bank was
                    very rare, though a considerable number of casualties were caused by splinters.
                    On the night of <date when="1915-07-24">July 24th</date> the enemy exploded a
                    mine immediately in front of the parapet of Trench 50, held by the 1/5th
                    Leicestershire Regiment, adjoining the left of our sector, causing some 50
                    casualties, and a half Company of the Battalion was sent up as support to the
                    1/4th Leicester Regiment in case of emergency, but were not required, as the
                    enemy did not attempt to occupy the crater.</p>
                <p>On <date when="1915-07-25">July 25th</date> we returned to the front line,
                    relieving the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment in trenches <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/36/mode/1up" xml:id="p36"/> 42 to 49. The sector now occupied consisted of a trench line,
                    of which the left portion was on high ground in front of Armagh Wood, the centre
                    crossed a dip in front of Square Wood, while the right sloped up to the rising
                    ground towards the <placeName key="Ieper, Belgium" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q102728" xml:id="place152">Ypres</placeName>-<placeName key="Comines, Belgium" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2463781" xml:id="place153">Comines</placeName> railway; the breadth of No Man's Land
                    varied from 200 yards to 25 yards. During this tour we experienced for the first
                    time a bombardment with heavy trench mortars (Minenwerfer), popularly known as
                    &quot;Minnies&quot;, which caused great damage to trenches, but the toll
                    of casualties was light. The work done was chiefly improving trenches and
                    especially the wire in front; while engaged in superintending the latter in
                    front of one of the machine gun emplacements, <persName key="Templeman, Francis James, 21 (d 1915)" ref="https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/1626050/" xml:id="pers109">

                    since mobilization, was killed. In addition to heavy trench mortars, we were
                    also frequently worried by small trench mortar bombs, popularly known as
                    &quot;Sausages&quot; from their shape. Their flight was slow, and could
                    be easily observed, and the garrisons of trenches exposed to them usually posted
                    a sentry, known as the &quot;sausage look-out&quot;, furnished with a
                    whistle, whose duty was to blow his whistle as a signal to take cover, whenever
                    he observed a bomb in flight.</p>
                <p>We were rather heavily shelled during the afternoon of <date when="1915-07-30">July 30th</date>, when the Germans made an attack on <placeName xml:id="place154">Hooge</placeName>, held by the Division on our left.
                    Beyond this the operation did not affect the Battalion, although the 139th
                    Brigade, who were holding the left of the Divisional sector, were involved, and
                    on the <date when="1915-07-30">30th</date> were seriously attacked, but owing to
                    their gallant defence, we were not called upon to assist.</p>
                <p>On <date when="1915-08-01">August 1st</date> we were relieved in trenches by the

                    24 days in the front line and support however, and having been rather heavily
                    shelled for the greater part of the time, the Battalion was quite ready for the
                    short rest which ensued for the next week. At dusk on <date when="1915-08-03">August 3rd</date>, the Battalion left the railway dug-outs and marched by

                    the city, where we were billeted for the night. This was the only occasion
                    during our tour in the Salient, when the Battalion actually entered <placeName key="Ieper, Belgium" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q102728" xml:id="place159">Ypres</placeName> itself, and on the afternoon of the

                    fire, with the band playing, was much enjoyed by all. We were allowed two days

                    only provided working parties for the construction of new dug-outs at Kruisstraat, while <date when="1915-08-08">Sunday, the 8th</date>, was also a rest day, and a Battalion Church Parade
                    was the only duty.</p>
                <p>On <date when="1915-08-09">August 9th</date>, we received orders to stand by,
                    ready to move at short notice, if required, to support the 6th Division, who on
                    this day made a successful counter attack on the <placeName xml:id="place162">Hooge</placeName> trenches, captured by the Germans on <date when="1915-07-29">July 29th</date>, but we were not called upon; we were

                    evening, but the orders for the relief were cancelled owing to heavy shelling
                    along the front, so we enjoyed an extra day's rest. On the night of <date when="1915-08-10">August 10th</date>, however, we again took over the trench

                    and our trenches re-constructed without any interference by the enemy. We were
                    relieved on the <date when="1915-08-25">25th</date> at 10 p.m. by the 1/4th
                    Leicestershire Regiment, and marched back to E huts at <placeName xml:id="place165">Ouderdom</placeName>, the last Company arriving there at 4
                    a.m. on the <date when="1915-08-29">29th</date>. To the great delight of the
                    Machine Gun Section our old .303 Converted Machine Guns were now exchanged for
                    six new .303 Vickers Guns, which were an immense improvement. The usual working
                    parties were supplied during the next few days during which the Battalion was
                    supplied with gas helmets to replace the respirators, which had previously been
                    our somewhat dubious protection against the most dreaded of all enemy weapons,
                    Gas.</p>
                <p>On <date when="1915-09-02">September 2nd</date>, unexpected orders were received
                    to relieve the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment in trenches that night, but the
                    march to trenches was considerably delayed by very heavy shelling of the Canal
                    bridges, which had to be crossed; eventually, however, the relief was completed
                    with very few casualties. The weather, which had been fine and warm for the past
                    fortnight, now broke completely, and heavy rain for the next two days caused
                    much damage to trenches, and necessitated an immense amount of work in drainage
                    and repair. On <date when="1915-09-05">September 5th</date> an unlucky isolated
                    shrapnel shell killed two men and wounded two officers, Lieuts. <persName key="Lowe, Archibald Marston, Lt" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/2712052" xml:id="pers123">

                    sometimes greater than that of a severe bombardment at other times.</p>
                <p>On <date when="1915-09-08">September 8th</date>, the Battalion was relieved in
                    the front line, and sent back to Brigade Reserve, being distributed with one
                    Company and Battalion Headquarters at the railway dug-outs, two Companies <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/40/mode/1up" xml:id="p40"/> in the dug-outs back at Brigade Headquarters
                    with one Company in immediate support of the front line in the newly constructed
                    dug-outs behind Square Wood. During the next few days the usual working parties
                    were supplied, and a small draft of 20 men joined the Battalion, but our
                    casualties had been rather heavy during the last two months, and we were at the
                    time very much below our establishment.</p>
                <p>On the night of <date when="1915-09-14">September 14th</date> we relieved the
                    1/4th Leicestershire Regiment in trenches, a heavy bombardment of the Square
                    Wood dug-outs having taken place during the afternoon, which necessitated the
                    provision and occupation of shelter trenches along the west end of the wood.
                    However, another heavy bombardment on the <date when="1915-09-15">next
                    day</date> led to the abandonment of these dug-outs, except for a small garrison
                    of one platoon, for whom ample shelter trenches were available, as it was
                    evident that the construction of these dug-outs, although behind the Wood and
                    not under direct observation of the enemy, had been carefully noted from German
                    aeroplanes. The shelter galleries at Battalion Headquarters were now complete,
                    somewhat to the relief of the Headquarters details, as the Headquarters dug-outs
                    had suffered rather severely lately, one shell actually penetrating into the
                    Orderly Room dug-out, but fortunately not exploding.</p>
                <p>On the <date when="1915-09-15">15th</date>, as one of our trenches, No. 47, had
                    received undue attention from &quot;sausages&quot; and rifle grenades,
                    an organised retaliation was arranged by <persName key="Nichols, John Sebastian, Capt" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/3240388" xml:id="pers125">

                    this epistle was felt by our bombers to be very gratifying.</p>
                <p>On <date when="1915-09-17">September 17th</date> we experienced the heaviest
                    bombardment to which we were ever subjected during our tour in the Salient. From
                    11.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m., a desultory bombardment with <choice>
                        <abbr>H.E.</abbr>
                        <expan>High Explosive</expan>
                    </choice> of various calibres, together with &quot;Whizz-bangs&quot;,
                    and &quot;Woolly-bears&quot; (heavy shrapnel) was directed on our
                    trenches; this apparently was in the nature of registration, and no serious
                    damage was done. For an hour there was complete calm, when suddenly at 5.30 p.m.
                    an intense bombardment of the whole of the front line facing Hill 60 with
                    shrapnel and <choice>
                        <abbr>H.E.</abbr>
                        <expan>High Explosive</expan>
                    </choice> of all calibres from 8 inch to whizz-bangs began, and continued for an
                    hour. Telephonic communication was almost immediately cut from Battalion
                    Headquarters to all Companies and also to Brigade and direct observation was
                    almost impossible, owing to dust and smoke; each Company Commander had therefore
                    to make independent plans to meet an infantry attack which we felt to be
                    imminent. At 6.30 p.m., however, the bombardment suddenly ceased without any
                    attempt at a German attack, and it was possible to examine the damage done. The
                    casualties were marvellously few, one killed, and two wounded, but the material
                    damage to trenches was immense. One long stretch of trench, 47 S., was
                    practically obliterated for some 200 yards, but fortunately this part was not
                    garrisoned, being practically a communication trench, but the result was that
                    the right Company was cut off from the remainder of the Battalion by daylight.

                    been cut off and badly wounded. Other trenches also suffered severely and the
                    whole Battalion worked hard all night at repair, but finding that it was
                    impossible to restore communication between the different parts of the front
                    line within a reasonable time, the Commanding Officer requested help from
                    Brigade, and on the evening of <date when="1915-09-18">September 18th</date>, a
                    working party of 200 from the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment was sent up to our

                <p>On <date when="1915-09-20">September 20th</date> began the long sustained

                    during this period our sector was particularly quiet. We were relieved the same
                    evening by 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment, and went back as Divisional Reserve,
                    being quartered in huts in a wood between <placeName xml:id="place167">Ouderdom</placeName> and <placeName key="Dikkebus, Ieper, Belgium" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2199190" xml:id="place168">Dickebusch</placeName>,
                    and allowed two days for rest. On the <date when="1915-09-23">23rd</date> in
                    view of the possibility of a rapid move in the near future, a packing trial was
                    carried out, the whole Transport being rapidly loaded up in the presence of the
                    Divisional Commander. The usual working parties were supplied during the next
                    two days and on the <date when="1915-09-26">26th</date> we returned to trenches
                    on a very wet night, which caused the march to the trenches over the mud roads
                    to be very heavy going, and the men arrived tired out, and wet through. On the

                    the Battalion marched once more on the well known Pavé roads, which we had

                    found. For the first time for many months we were outside the range of shell

                    enjoyed; the only work done was the refitting of the men with clothing, much of
                    which was worn out by the trench work of the last three months. On <date when="1915-10-04">October 4th</date> some Company training was carried out,

                    the crowded condition of the area, occupied as it was by a squadron of the Royal
                    Flying Corps, no room could be found for the other half Battalion, which
                    eventually found billets in the adjoining village of <placeName key="Gosnay, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q741641" xml:id="place182">Gosnay</placeName>. In these quarters we remained for the
                    next six days practising Company and Battalion attack in open warfare, the
                    actual formations to be adopted in the attack on the Hohenzollern Redoubt being
                    assiduously rehearsed. A model of the position was constructed at Divisional
                    Headquarters which was studied by the officers, and every opportunity was
                    afforded to all ranks to learn the exact part they were expected to perform in

                    detailed to lead us to the trenches in which we were to relieve the Irish
                    Guards. At <placeName key="Vermelles, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q876024" xml:id="place187">Vermelles</placeName> each Company
                    halted and were served out with the tools and bombs to be carried in the attack
                        <date when="1915-10-13">next day</date>. The bombs were served out packed in
                    sandbags under superintendence of the Divisional Bomb Officer, and were
                    naturally accepted by the Company Commanders as serviceable stores, but on
                    arrival in trenches, when distributed to the men, much of the load carried from
                        <placeName key="Vermelles, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q876024" xml:id="place188">Vermelles</placeName> proved utterly useless
                    consisting of rifle grenades without rods, and old bombs of all patterns, and
                    the result was a shortage of bombs after the attack at a time of urgent need,
                    which had most serious consequences. The night was very dark, the position of
                    course entirely strange to the Battalion, and the guides appeared more uncertain
                    of their way than usual, so that the relief was very slow, but was ultimately
                    accomplished at 2 a.m. The disposition of the Battalion was four half Companies
                    with Battalion Headquarters in the front line and four half Companies in the
                    support line, 50 yards in rear. Excepting the necessary sentries all ranks were
                    instructed to get as much rest as possible, but the order was more honoured in
                    the <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/47/mode/1up" xml:id="p47"/> breach than in the observance,

                        <expan>Non-Commissioned Officers</expan>
                    </choice> who were hard at work practically the whole night. After stand-to at
                    dawn on <date when="1915-10-13">October 13th</date>, the Battalion devoted
                    itself to a good breakfast, and the morning was spent in organizing the details
                    of the attack. At noon the preliminary bombardment began, probably the heaviest
                    and most concentrated artillery attack by the British Army up to that date, as
                    had been promised by the <rs key="Haking, Richard Cyril Byrne, Lt-Gen" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q955135" type="person" xml:id="pers809">Corps Commander</rs>; the enemy retaliation was not very
                    severe, but a good many casualties were caused owing to the necessarily crowded
                    condition of the trenches. The wind being favourable, gas cylinders having been
                    previously installed in the front line, a gas cloud was discharged towards the
                    enemy trenches at 1.45 p.m., but a certain number of casualties were sustained
                    in our own front line, as the wind was gusty and occasionally drove back the
                    cloud into portions of our own trenches. Zero hour was 2 p.m., when the
                    Battalion left the trenches, and advanced &quot;over the top&quot; on
                    the enemy position.</p>
                <p>It is not possible or desirable in a Battalion History to give the details of the
                    whole operation, but it must be explained that the attack of the 46th Division
                    on <date when="1915-10-13">October 13th, 1915</date>, was planned with two
                    brigades in the front line, the 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade on the right and
                    the 138th (Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade on the left with the 139th (Sherwood
                    Foresters) Brigade in support. In the 138th Brigade two Battalions were in the
                    front line, the 1/4th Leicestershire on the right, the 1/5th Lincolnshire on the
                    left, with 1/4th Lincolnshire in support, and 1/5th Leicestershire in reserve.
                    Each of the leading Battalions advanced in four waves, each Company moving in
                    lines of platoons, the two leading platoons of each Company starting from the
                        <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/48/mode/1up" xml:id="p48"/> front line, and the two rear platoons from
                    the support line. The distribution of the Companies in the Battalion was A, B,
                    C, D from right to left, with Battalion Headquarters in the centre, and the
                    first objective was the Fosse Trench in the German Line about 400
                    <corr>yards</corr> behind the <choice>

                    </choice> face of the Hohenzollern Redoubt, which consisted of an oval work
                    about 200 yards by 150, pushed forward from the Fosse Trench, and joined to it
                    by several communication trenches; the Redoubt was situated on slightly rising
                    ground, which dipped again behind towards the Fosse Trench, and was the only
                    part of our objective actually visible from our own trenches.</p>
                <p>When the artillery lifted at 2 p.m.—it must be remembered that this was long
                    before the idea of the &quot;creeping barrage&quot;—the infantry of the
                    Division advanced most gallantly to the attack. The wire in front of the Redoubt
                    was well cut, and the Battalion swept over the <choice>

                    front of the Fosse trench came under such heavy rifle and machine gun fire from
                    the front and from both flanks, that the lines melted away, and further advance
                    became impossible; although numerous isolated parties maintained themselves in
                    shell holes at various points until dusk, the line as a whole was compelled to
                    retire to the <choice>

                    </choice> face of the Hohenzollern Redoubt, which was con-solidated for defence.
                    The 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment on our right were in the same situation,
                    exposed to very heavy frontal and enfilade rifle and machine gun fire, as the
                    Brigade on our right was unable to advance owing to uncut wire, and the German
                    position at Mad Point on our left was a nest of machine guns which our artillery
                    were unable to silence. All ranks behaved most gallantly, but <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/49/mode/1up" xml:id="p49"/> the very heavy casualties in Officers and <choice>

                    but all keen and prepared to work hard in the interests of their adopted
                    Battalion, while on the <date when="1915-11-10">10th</date>, a draft of 171 men
                    and 5 officers arrived from the 2/5th Lincolnshire Regiment in England. These
                    reinforcements brought us practically up to establishment in officers, but still
                    leaving us very much below strength in other ranks. The weather continued cold
                    and wet, but steady training was carried on as far as possible in the sodden low
                    lying fields round <placeName key="Robecq, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q469871" xml:id="place196">Robecq</placeName> until the

                <p>On <date when="1915-11-13">November 13th</date> the Battalion marched to

                        Barbée</placeName>, finding billets in some scattered and shell-shattered
                    hovels; it rained all the way, the roads <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/55/mode/1up" xml:id="p55"/> were
                    muddy and crowded with the Indian Divisions then leaving France, and the billets
                    allotted for the Battalion only existed on the descriptions of them circulated
                    by the Staff. The officers went up to reconnoitre the line of trenches in front
                    of <placeName key="Richebourg-Saint-Vaast, Richebourg, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2149768" xml:id="place200">Richebourg St. Vaast</placeName>, and on the
                        <date when="1915-11-17">17th</date> the Battalion relieved the 1/6th North
                    Staffordshire Regiment, being distributed with three Companies in the line, and
                    one in support.</p>
                <p>The trenches were shallow, and indescribably muddy and wet; a jumbled mass of
                    bricks and stone, with one solitary brick wall 100 yards behind marked the
                    village; in front stretched some 300 yards of No Man's Land, a swamp crossed by
                    numerous ditches, bank-high with muddy water. On the left front the black bulk
                    of the Bois de Biez loomed through the mist about a quarter of a mile behind the
                    line of mud, which marked the German parapet. The opposing artillery, blinded by
                    the fog, rumbled but rarely, but the machine guns made the night hideous,
                    particularly for those carrying rations and stores over the open, all
                    communication trenches having been long since incorporated into the river system
                    of the country.</p>
                <p>On <date when="1915-11-20">November 20th</date>, we were relieved, and returned
                    to billets at <placeName xml:id="place201">Croix Barbée</placeName>, moving
                        <date when="1915-11-20">next day</date> to Rue de Chevattes, where the
                    Battalion remained till the <date when="1915-11-24">24th</date>, supplying the
                    usual working parties while out of trenches. On the evening of the <date when="1915-11-24">24th</date>, while Battalion Headquarters remained at Rue
                    de Chevattes, the Battalion took over a line of trenches from Quinque Rue to
                    Farm Cour d'Avoué, two Companies being in the line, one in support at Fuise Station, and one at Battalion
                    Headquarters. On the <date when="1915-11-26">26th</date>, an inter-company
                    relief took place, and meanwhile the weather changed and hard frost succeeded
                    the rain, making the ground too hard to dig, but on the <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/56/mode/1up" xml:id="p56"/> other hand rendering locomotion easier, and enabling several
                    derelict trenches to be occupied, as the water in them froze. The previous
                    occupants had been much too engaged in fighting to think of safety and comfort,
                    and the almost complete absence of dug-outs was keenly felt in a temperature
                    approaching Zero Fahrenheit. Plenty of occupation was usually found by everyone
                    in changing socks and oiling feet with a view to prevention of frost bite.</p>
                <p>After another inter-company relief on the <date when="1915-11-29">29th</date>, we
                    were relieved by the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment on the <date when="1915-11-30">30th</date>, and marched back to billets at <placeName key="Le Touret, La Couture, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2014613" xml:id="place203">Etouret</placeName>, which were not reached till 3.15 a.m.
                    on <date when="1915-12-01">December 1st</date>. At this time the Battalion,
                    cheerfully resigned to the prospect of a winter in Flanders, was roused suddenly
                    to enthusiasm by the unexpected receipt of Orders at 3 a.m. on <date when="1915-12-03">December 3rd</date> that the Division would at once
                    proceed to the East. During the day the 20 mile march was completed to
                        <placeName key="Le Sart, Merville, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2005112" xml:id="place204">Le Sart</placeName>, a village <choice>

                    a fortnight's duration was enjoyed to allow the Division to concentrate, daily
                    Company training and an occasional route march filling up the time. On the <date when="1915-12-14">14th</date> a number of officers proceeded to <placeName key="Lillers, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q383388" xml:id="place206">Lillers</placeName> and <placeName key="Berguette, Isbergues, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3638566" xml:id="place207">Berguette</placeName> to inspect the entraining arrangements at those
                    stations, preparatory to the move to the East. On <date when="1915-12-19">December 19th</date>, the Battalion moved to new billets at <placeName key="Thiennes, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q768367" xml:id="place208">Thiennes</placeName>, near <placeName key="Aire-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q259903" xml:id="place209">Aire</placeName>, and for the next week training in open warfare was
                    energetically carried out. The weather was now mild, and Christmas was spent by
                    everyone in great comfort and some measure of good cheer, the distance from the
                    &quot;dykes&quot;, as the trenches were then colloquially termed, being
                    sufficiently great to permit of this. A fund had been raised in Lincolnshire by

                <p>After Christmas, training in open warfare was resumed, Battalion and Brigade
                    schemes frequently carried out and outpost training assiduously practised. The
                    long delay, however, caused some anxiety to those looking forward to a winter in
                    Egypt, but at length on <date when="1916-01-04">January 4th, 1916</date>, the
                    long expected and anxiously awaited orders to move arrived, and on <date when="1916-01-05">January 5th</date>, the Battalion marched at 9.30 a.m. to

                    leaving at 4.40 p.m. in high spirits at leaving the mud and cold of Flanders
                    behind, with roseate visions of the East in our thoughts.</p>

                    </choice> of France is difficult to describe, and still more so to appreciate
                    correctly. The immediate future was very obscure; rumour said the Battalion was
                    bound for Serbia! The journey was as thoroughly uncomfortable in every small
                    detail as the disorganised railway service of France could make it. But as the
                    murkiness and mud of the North gave place to the brilliant sunshine, dazzling
                    white roofs, and olives of the South, the spirits of all defied uncertainty, and
                    rose against reason. During the first day the men huddled together for warmth in
                    their cattle-trucks, and peered through the mist at the shell-stricken villages
                    they passed; on the second they lounged at the open doorways; on the third they
                    sat on the roofs in their shirt sleeves, reduced to silence in their
                    appreciation of the turbulent Rhone in the foreground on the right, and the snow
                    clad Alps seen over a long vista of terraced vineyards on the left.</p>
                <p>We arrived at <placeName key="Marseille, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23482" xml:id="place211">Marseilles</placeName> at 8.15 p.m. on
                        <date when="1916-01-07">January 7th</date>, and a hurried march through the
                    deserted streets was followed by embarkation at the docks at 2 p.m. on the <date when="1916-01-08">8th</date>.</p>
                <p>The voyage was uneventful, the weather monotonously pleasant, and from the time
                    that the rocky coast of Southern France was lost to view until the sunburnt
                    looking coast of Malta appeared, the normal routine was an unvaried succession
                    of meals, sleep, <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/59/mode/1up" xml:id="p59"/> and submarine alarms, which
                    fortunately did not materialise. Probably on account of the last mentioned, when
                    off Malta, our vessel turned and steamed hurriedly back for 12 hours, then as
                    suddenly turned again, and finally arrived off <placeName key="Alexandria, Egypt" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q87" xml:id="place212">Alexandria</placeName> at 10 a.m. on <date when="1916-01-13">January
                    13th</date>.</p>
                <p>The town appeared as a white spot on a desert shore from a distance, but on
                    closer acquaintance the prospect was somewhat marred by dirt and a dust storm.
                    However, the suburbs appeared very beautiful but the Battalion was hurriedly
                    entrained on the quay at 2 a.m. on the <date when="1916-01-14">14th</date>, and
                    there was little rest for anyone until <date when="1916-01-15">next day</date>
                    the train stopped at <placeName xml:id="place213" key="Mahsama, Egypt" ref="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=30.561965_N_32.011413_E_globe:earth">Mahsana</placeName>, where the
                    engine apparently broke down; at any rate, we stopped for 18 hours, which
                    afforded a full day's rest for quiet reflection and the opportunity of
                    inspecting a native village. The destination of the Battalion, <placeName key="Shallufa, Egypt" ref="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=30.113503_N_32.548198_E_globe:earth" xml:id="place214">El Shalufa</placeName>, a few mud huts on the Suez Canal,

                    </choice> of the Bitter Lakes, was reached at 11 a.m. on <date when="1916-01-15">January 15th</date>. We detrained, crossed the Canal by ferry, and
                    proceeded to bivouac; tents for officers and men arrived a few hours later, but
                    no drinking water or rations until the <date when="1916-01-16">next day</date>.</p>
                <p>The Camp at <placeName key="Shallufa, Egypt" ref="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=30.113503_N_32.548198_E_globe:earth" xml:id="place215">Shalufa</placeName>, occupied by the
                    Staffordshire Brigade and the two Lincolnshire Battalions, was was situated on
                    the East bank of the Suez Canal, only separated from it by a single line of low
                    sand-dunes. To the east of the men's lines were a few shallow trenches, and then
                    about 60 miles of gently undulating rock strewn desert, ending on the horizon in
                    a range of mountains of which every detail stood out with surprising clearness.
                    To the west of the Canal another range about five miles away seemed only about
                    as many hundred yards, rising very steeply from the desert, and apparently
                    absolutely sterile and arid. The days were very hot, the nights <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/60/mode/1up" xml:id="p60"/> equally cold, and any wind that blew raised
                    clouds of sand, but nevertheless a fortnight passed very pleasantly. The
                    defensive trenches were worked at on the <date when="1916-01-15">first
                    day</date>, and subsequently open warfare training was carried out daily, varied
                    by close order drill, and musketry. By day the desert to the <choice>

                        <expan>East</expan>
                    </choice> was patrolled for many miles by squadrons of Indian Lancers, but by
                    night each of the Battalions furnished an outpost line round the camp in turn;
                    we occupied the outpost line on the nights of <date when="1916-01-20">20th</date> and <date when="1916-01-26">26th January</date>.</p>
                <p>This peaceful existence, was rudely disturbed by the news that the Division was
                    to return immediately to France, and <date when="1916-01-29">January 29th</date>
                    was spent in hurriedly packing and handing over to units of the 42nd Division;
                    at 6.15 p.m., the Battalion entrained, arriving at 7 a.m. on <date when="1916-01-30">January 30th</date> at <placeName xml:id="place216">Sid
                        Gabaeh</placeName>, close to <placeName key="Alexandria, Egypt" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q87" xml:id="place217">Alexandria</placeName>, and situated almost on the beach. Here we drew tents
                    and pitched camp, the work for the next two days consisting of Battalion drill,
                    and the relaxation of trips to <placeName key="Alexandria, Egypt" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q87" xml:id="place218">Alexandria</placeName>, either on small donkeys or by very efficient trams. On
                        <date when="1916-02-02">February 2nd</date>, we received orders to stand-by
                    ready to move at any time, but it was not until the <date when="1916-02-03">next
                        day</date> that we proceeded to <placeName key="Alexandria, Egypt" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q87" xml:id="place219">Alexandria</placeName>, and re-embarked at 1.30 p.m. on <name>S.S.
                    Megantic</name> to return to France. The vessel belonged to the White Star Line,
                    and was most comfortably and admirably managed in all ways. We sailed at 12 noon
                    on <date when="1916-02-04">February 4th</date>, and had an uneventful voyage,
                    passing Malta on the <date when="1916-02-06">6th</date>, arriving at Marseilles
                    on <date when="1916-02-09">February 9th</date>, disembarking and entraining
                    within a few hours. The reverse change to that on the outward journey, from
                    sunlight and Peace to gloom and squalor and War was experienced, and we
                    detrained at 11.30 a.m. on <date when="1916-02-11">February 11th</date> at
                        <placeName key="Pont-Remy, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q668466" xml:id="place220">Pont Remy</placeName> station in a cold

                    somewhat depressed, to find billets of the old familiar type.</p>
                <p>Battalion life was arranged for the next few weeks with the one object of
                    re-acclimatising the men to the mist and cold of Flanders, and re-accustoming
                    all ranks to the tactics and conditions of trench warfare, training in which had
                    been entirely neglected during the past three months. The weather was uniformly
                    bad, snow, thaw, and rain succeeding each other, but training was carried on as
                    far as weather conditions allowed. The Battalion remained in the same billets
                    till <date when="1916-02-20">February 20th</date>, when we marched to <placeName key="Autheux, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q45657" xml:id="place222">Autheux</placeName> where training continued on the same
                    lines. On <date when="1916-02-22">February 22nd</date>, the Machine Gun Section
                    of the Battalion came to an end, the gunners being transferred to the Machine
                    Gun Corps, while the machine guns were replaced in the Battalion by Lewis Guns,
                    and for the next few weeks the training of men in Lewis Gun work was made the
                    most important part of the programme. On <date when="1916-02-24">February
                        24th</date> we again moved billets to <placeName key="Bonneville, Somme, Picardie, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q971323" xml:id="place223">Bonneville</placeName>, each change bringing us nearer to the battle zone, and
                    on the <date when="1916-02-29">29th</date> we marched via <placeName key="Beauval, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1092270" xml:id="place224">Beauval</placeName> to <placeName key="Gezaincourt, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q157091" xml:id="place225">Gelincourt</placeName>.

                    After two miles of trenches the party emerged into the open in the Talus des
                    Zouaves, a valley deep and narrow enough to afford protection from shell fire,
                    though within 500 yards of the front line. From the Talus a main communication
                    trench, the Boyau Vincent, brought them to the support line, and Battalion
                    Headquarters, where they were hospitably received by their French hosts, by whom
                    they were shown round the trenches.</p>
                <p>On <date when="1916-03-06">March 6th</date>, the Brigade marched to <placeName key="Petit-Houvin, Hautecloque, France" ref="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=50.325545_N_2.322603_E_globe:earth" xml:id="place231">Houvin</placeName>, and after <date when="1916-03-07">a

                    Headquarters, and thence by Platoons into the trenches, relieving the 90th
                    Regiment of French Infantry.</p>
                <p>The sector now occupied was one in which the trenches were very sketchy,
                    consisting mainly of isolated posts, which could only be reached at night, and
                    over the open, as communication trenches to some did not exist and to others
                    were so shallow and exposed as to be useless. All the trenches were shallow, and
                    any effort to deepen them usually resulted in the shelling of the points worked
                    at, as the chalky soil of the Vimy Ridge made newly thrown up soil stand up
                    clearly as a white line, which provided an excellent object on which enemy
                    artillery could range. Three Companies were distributed in the front line, of
                    which one could be reached by day, and one Company in support round Battalion
                    Headquarters. On the night of the <date when="1916-03-12">12th</date>, the
                    Germans exploded a small mine close to the parapet of one of our trenches, and

                    showed great coolness and resource under heavy fire in organising the defence at
                    the threatened point and repelling the bombing attack, and was subsequently

                    enable us to hold our sector in the line without assistance from other

                    dug-outs were situated on the reverse slope of the valley, the sides of which
                    were so steep as to afford them almost complete protection. On the <date when="1916-04-14">14th</date>, we returned to the trenches for our last tour

                <p>During the time the Brigade held it, the sector was immensely improved and
                    strengthened; the trenches were deepened and drained, a certain amount of
                    shelter provided, and an entirely new defensive position prepared behind the
                    front line. More important still all the isolated posts had been connected with
                    the defence line by communication trenches, which rendered communication
                    possible by day with all portions of the line to the great advantage of

                    promote greater smartness in appearance. Baths were available for the men at the

                    to Company training, and this routine with occasional modifications was
                    continued for the next fortnight. The Battalion usually paraded at 9 a.m. and
                    marched into the forest, working till 1 p.m. when one hour was allowed for
                    dinner, which was cooked in the field kitchens which we took out with us, and
                    worked again from 2 to 4.30 p.m., when we returned to billets. After tea the
                    band usually played which added much to our enjoyment.</p>
                <p>The work in the Forest consisted of felling saplings, trimming them, and finally
                    weaving them into hurdles, or tying them into fascines, which were destined to
                    be used in the assembly trenches then being prepared for the forth-coming attack
                    on the Somme, rumours of which had reached our ears; the work was carried on
                    under the superintendence of an <choice>

                        <expan>Royal Engineers</expan>
                    </choice> detachment and the men soon became apt pupils. At the first accidents
                    were frequent, as felling axes and bill-hooks are somewhat dangerous weapons in
                    unskilled hands, and their use is fraught with considerable danger to a careless
                    or incompetent wielder, but the quantity of completed hurdles and fascines
                    gradually increased each day for the same hours of work, and the average man in
                    the Battalion accounted himself a fair woodman by the end of our experience in
                    Forestry.</p>
                <p>During this period each Company in turn was struck off duty for a few days for
                    anti-typhoid inoculation or re-inoculation, the immense value of which had
                    already been conclusively proved; many sore arms, much bad language, and more
                    grousing was the immediate result but the future good health <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/69/mode/1up" xml:id="p69"/> of the Battalion, and our practical immunity from enteric
                    fever during the whole campaign was the ultimate result, well worth it all. On
                        <date when="1916-05-15">May 15th</date>, a strong draft of four officers and
                    330 other ranks reached the Battalion, while four more officers of the Middlesex

                        17th</date>, the routine was varied by a Battalion operation, the
                    opportunity being taken of practising wood-fighting, and marching through the
                    Forest on a compass bearing, under the supervision of the <rs key="Stuart-Wortley, Edward James Montagu, Maj-Gen" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3048565" type="person" xml:id="pers826">Divisional

                    was a period of unalloyed happy memory to all, except the victims of inoculation
                    already referred to, and the Battalion returned on <date when="1916-05-20">20th</date> to the trench area marching through <placeName key="Pas-en-Artois, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q852798" xml:id="place255">Pas-en-Artois</placeName>, where Divisional Headquarters were situated, to

                    of the front line, was still occupied by a considerable number of its original
                    inhabitants, and the land was cultivated to within a short distance of the
                    trenches, as the enemy, owing to the wooded nature of the terrain, had no direct
                    observation, and aeroplanes were still few and far between. For many months this
                    had been one of the quietest parts on the British <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/70/mode/1up" xml:id="p70"/> Front, but as our preparations for attack became apparent to
                    the enemy, his artillery activity gradually increased, and life was not quite so
                    peaceful from this time forward.</p>
                <p>For the next fortnight training was entirely put aside, the whole Battalion being
                    employed on the construction of assembly trenches and communication trenches

                    where they were not under observation, the other half by night, where new
                    trenches were sited in the open; by <date when="1916-05-28">May 28th</date> all
                    trenches were so far advanced that further work on them could be safely carried

                    to be allotted to each Company, of which they became henceforth an integral

                    being distributed with two Companies in the front line, one Company in support
                    in dug-outs about 400 yards in the rear, and one Company in reserve with
                    Battalion Headquarters in <placeName key="Foncquevillers, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1031945" xml:id="place266">Fonquevillers</placeName>
                    village, which lay about 800 yards behind the front line. The work in progress
                    in the trench area consisted of the preparation of several lines of assembly
                    trenches behind the front line, while a new trench in No Man's Land, here some
                    400 to 500 yards wide, was taped out on the night of <date when="1916-06-07">June 7th</date> about 200 yards in advance of our original front line, the
                    Battalion supplying covering parties to enable this to be done.</p>
                <p>On the night of <date when="1916-06-08">June 8th</date> a covering party of two
                    platoons with Lewis Guns was pushed well forward, while one and a half companies
                    and the whole the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment dug about 400 yards of the new
                    trench down to a depth of 3 feet 6 inches, during the night. The enemy evidently
                    was aware of the proceedings to some extent, and the work was carried on under
                    heavy shrapnel and machine gun fire, which caused us 15 casualties. The 1/4th
                    Lincolnshire Battalion suffered somewhat heavily, their Commanding Officer,

                    being dangerously wounded. On the next two nights, <date when="1916-06-09">June

                    enable it to be occupied for observation purposes, the garrison consisting of
                    one platoon by day, and three platoons by night. By day work on the assembly
                    trenches was continued, trench mortar positions and ammunition stores were

                    covering parties, while working parties of the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment
                    continued the wiring and improvement of the advanced trench, known as the Bush
                    Trench. Meanwhile it was evident that the enemy by this time had observed the
                    immense amount of work being done, and the days of the &quot;quiet

                    persistent, and it was therefore with considerable satisfaction that after a
                    spell of 14 days continuous work in the front line we were informed that we were

                <p>During the next few days a certain amount of training was performed, but the

                <head>The Battle of Gommecourt</head>
                <p>At daybreak on <date when="1916-07-01">July 1st, 1916</date>, the Battalion was
                    resting in the Corps Line 1,000 yards East of <placeName key="Souastre, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q382038" xml:id="place287">Souastre</placeName>, the 138th Brigade being the Reserve Brigade in the
                    Divisional attack on <placeName key="Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q991861" xml:id="place288">Gommecourt</placeName>, which
                    was carried out by the 137th and 139th Brigades. In spite of a very gallant
                    advance the attack was unsuccessful; the attacking waves who had entered the
                    German trenches could not be supported owing to the very heavy German artillery
                    barrage, and although they held out for many hours, they were gradually
                    surrounded and overwhelmed.</p>
                <p>At 8.30 a.m., the Battalion advanced by platoons in artillery formation across
                    the open ground between <placeName key="Souastre, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q382038" xml:id="place289">Souastre</placeName> and
                        <placeName key="Foncquevillers, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1031945" xml:id="place290">Fonquevillers</placeName>, and reached the
                    Midland trench in the rear of that village without casualties. The whole day was
                    spent in this trench under a heavy bombardment during the afternoon, which
                    caused some casualties, ten Other Ranks being killed and one wounded. We could
                    obtain no information as to the success or otherwise of the operations, but as
                    the day wore on, and no further orders to advance were received, it was realised
                    that the attack must have failed. At length at 8.30 p.m., orders were received
                    to send up two officers per Company to reconnoitre the enemy front line trenches
                    in front of Gommecourt Wood, which had been unsuccessfully attacked by the 137th
                    Brigade, and the situation, as far as it could be ascertained was explained by
                    the Brigade Commander. It was supposed that <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/75/mode/1up" xml:id="p75"/>
                    isolated parties of the 139th Brigade were still holding out in the enemy
                    trenches, possibly in their front line, and orders were received that the
                    Battalion would attack at 11 p.m., occupy and consolidate the German front line,
                    getting into touch if possible with any parties of the Sherwood Foresters, who
                    might be still holding out in the German trenches on the left of the frontage
                    assigned for the Battalion attack, while on the right the 1/5th Battalion
                    Leicestershire Regiment would dig a defensive flank connecting the German with
                    our own front line. These orders were received at 9 p.m. but it was represented
                    that as the Company Commanders had gone up to the front to reconnoitre according
                    to previous orders, it would be impossible by 11 p.m. for them to organise their
                    Companies for attack, as it would first be necessary to reach the front line,
                    and relieve the 139th Brigade; accordingly the hour of attack was fixed for 12
                    midnight, and an artillery barrage on the German second line arranged for that
                    hour. At 9.30 p.m., the Battalion started to leave the Midland Trench, and
                    proceed through <placeName key="Foncquevillers, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1031945" xml:id="place291">Fonquevillers</placeName> up to the
                    front line. The communication trenches were found badly battered by shell fire,
                    with many dead bodies in them, and very congested by stragglers and wounded
                    coming in from No Man's Land, and consequently progress was very slow, and it
                    was 11 p.m. before the Company Commanders were met and received their orders
                    from the <rs key="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115592757" type="person" xml:id="pers828"><choice>

                        </choice> Battalion</rs>. The whole Battalion was ordered to attack in four
                    lines of platoons on a four company frontage, and as quickly as possible was
                    drawn up in this formation in No Man's Land. At 11.30 p.m., the orders from
                    Brigade were suddenly changed, and the Battalion was ordered not to consolidate
                    the German front line trench when occupied, but to retire as soon as touch with
                    the <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/76/mode/1up" xml:id="p76"/> parties of the Sherwood Foresters was
                    obtained, and bring them back, and in any case to retire to our own lines before
                    dawn; this change of orders did not reach the Company Commanders until the
                    advance had begun. At 12 midnight on <date when="1916-07-01">July
                        1st</date>-<date when="1916-07-02">2nd</date>, although only one Company was
                    really ready, the first line of platoons went forward, but in the darkness lost
                    touch and direction almost at once, and only two platoons reached the enemy
                    wire, which was found uncut. The enemy trench was found to be strongly held, and
                    very heavy rifle and machine gun fire was opened on the Battalion, while
                    innumerable flares and Verey lights lit up the front line. Further advance was
                    obviously impossible, and to avoid further useless casualties, the <rs key="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115592757" type="person" xml:id="pers829">

                    was made. Meanwhile the situation was pointed out to the <rs key="Kemp, Geoffrey Chicheley, Brig-Gen" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/2224676" type="person" xml:id="pers830">Brigade Commander</rs> by telephone,
                    explaining that the enemy front line was strongly held, that the wire was uncut,
                    that it was obvious that no parties of Sherwoods were in the objective assigned
                    to the Battalion, and that it was impossible to gain this objective. In spite of
                    this the <rs key="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115592757" type="person" xml:id="pers831"><choice>

                        Commander</rs> insisted on another attempt being made as soon as the attack
                    could be reorganised and accordingly a valiant attempt was made to regain
                    direction and touch within the Battalion, preparatory to another advance. The
                    night was intensely dark, and the task was very difficult, and before the
                    Battalion was ready to advance again instructions were received by telephone
                    from the <rs key="Kemp, Geoffrey Chicheley, Brig-Gen" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/2224676" type="person" xml:id="pers833">Brigadier</rs> that

                    attack would be made; the Battalion would withdraw to our old front line, and
                    during the remaining hours of darkness endeavour to bring in all wounded in <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/77/mode/1up" xml:id="p77"/> No Man's Land, of whom there were many from

                    casualties. The conduct of all ranks was excellent, and the officers did their
                    best in most adverse circumstances, but the task allotted to the Battalion was
                    really hopeless from the beginning. To expect a single Battalion in a night
                    attack to capture an enemy trench with uncut wire, which a Brigade had failed to
                    take earlier in the day, with the enemy very much on the alert in consequence,
                    is at the best a forlorn hope; when it is realised that the time to organize the
                    attack was far too short, that owing to darkness, blocking of trenches, and the
                    confusion produced by numerous stragglers and wounded from other units,
                    communication of orders and preliminary organisation for the assembly before the
                    advance were very difficult, it is obvious that failure was inevitable, and that
                    no discredit is reflected on the Battalion. On the contrary the fact that, when
                    the first attack was held up, no retirement was made but the Battalion lay out
                    in No Man's Land under heavy rifle and machine gun fire, and maintained its
                    position until the <rs key="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115592757" type="person" xml:id="pers835">

                <p>The day passed quietly, and several wounded men succeeded in crawling back from

                <p>The next day, <date when="1916-07-03">July 3rd</date>, was again very quiet on
                    our sector, and was spent in clearing and repairing trenches, and about 7.30
                    p.m. the 1/4th Battalion Royal Fusiliers began to arrive to relieve us, and
                    relief was completed by 11 p.m. The Battalion proceeded to <placeName key="Foncquevillers, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1031945" xml:id="place295">Fonquevillers</placeName>, but instead of returning to
                    billets, was directed to relieve the 11th Royal Warwickshire Regiment in a
                    sector of trenches immediately North of those previously occupied, our right
                    resting on the <placeName key="La Brayelle, Bucquoy, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23804998" xml:id="place296">La Brayelle</placeName> road, the
                    relief being completed by 4 a.m. on the <date when="1916-07-04">4th</date>. The
                    trenches in this sector were more than 1,000 yards from the enemy lines, with
                    the exception of two advanced lines of trenches 150 and 300 yards respectively
                    in front of the original front line, which were in an unfinished state, and
                    devoid of shelter, and were therefore not occupied by day and only patrolled at
                    night to prevent the enemy taking advantage of them. Three Companies were
                    distributed in the front line, with one Company in support at Battalion
                    Headquarters in dug-outs near the cross roads in front of <placeName key="Hannescamps, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q910804" xml:id="place297">Hannescamps</placeName> village.</p>
                <p>The weather now suddenly changed; the last week had been gloriously fine with
                    brilliant sunshine, but heavy rain fell during the next few days at intervals,
                    and the trenches became flooded, the advanced trenches were 4 feet deep in
                    water, and the communication trenches in places were waist deep. At the same
                    time the weather was very warm, <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/81/mode/1up" xml:id="p81"/> and although
                    there was much discomfort, there was little real hardship, and the carrying
                    parties to the front line became a source of much amusement, and the subject of
                    much friendly chaff in the matter of their dress, as trousers were abandoned,
                    their clothing consisting of shirts, jackets, boots, supplemented in the case of
                    the more modest spirits by home-made bathing drawers made from sandbags. The
                    sector was a very quiet one, and with the exception of rather heavy shelling of
                    the dug-outs of the Support Company, and Battalion Headquarters, from 11 a.m. to
                    12 noon on <date when="1916-07-05">July 5th</date>, no special incident occurred

                    relieved by the Queen's Westminsters at 9 a.m. No warning of this proposed
                    relief had been given by the Brigade, and as a consequence the Queen's
                    Westminster Officers, who had arrived early in the morning, stating that they
                    wished to reconnoitre the trenches before taking over, were promptly put under

                    Next day the Battalion rested, while the officers inspected the <placeName key="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q998666" xml:id="place313">Bienvillers</placeName> Defences and their Alarm Posts;
                    the area was being rather heavily shelled and the party consisting of the

                    on one occasion. During the next few days at least three Companies were detailed
                    for working parties daily on communication trenches and dug-outs, and only the
                    specialists were able to carry out any training, while one Company carried out

                <p>On <date when="1916-07-30">July 30th</date> we relieved the 1/4th Lincolnshire
                    Regiment in trenches at 7.30 p.m., and were rather heavily shelled next morning,
                    considerable material damage being done, but no casualties caused. The enemy
                    were also very active during this and subsequent days with trench mortars, which
                    as usual caused much destruction of trenches but very few casualties. We were
                    relieved on the evening of <date when="1916-08-03">August 3rd</date>, but owing
                    to heavy shelling of the usual communication trenches, an alternative route had
                    to be used to reach the billets at <placeName key="Pommier, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1029194" xml:id="place316">Pommier</placeName> in Divisional Reserve. Three Companies carried out training
                    daily during the next week, the other Company being struck off duty for
                    inoculation, and on <date when="1916-08-09">August 9th</date> we returned to
                    trenches, relief being completed at 8.30 p.m. During this tour gas cylinders
                    were installed in a large number of our <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/85/mode/1up" xml:id="p85"/> front
                    trenches to the great disgust of the garrisons, as they were a constant source
                    of annoyance owing to leakage, and an ever-present danger in case of enemy
                    shelling, as damage to a cylinder involved an instantaneous gas cloud in the
                    trench, and gave the men no time to put on gas masks; naturally all ranks looked
                    eagerly forward to the day, which was unfortunately somewhat distant, when the
                    wind would be favourable, and the cylinders discharged to distribute the gas in
                    the enemy trenches instead of our own. The enemy remained very quiet, and the
                    tour passed without incident until our relief on the <date when="1916-08-15">15th</date>, when the Battalion returned to <placeName key="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q998666" xml:id="place317">Bienvillers</placeName> as Brigade Reserve. The usual routine of one

                    observed until <date when="1916-08-21">August 21st</date> without
                    incident except on the 16th, when <placeName key="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q998666" xml:id="place319">Bienvillers</placeName> was rather heavily shelled with the usual retaliation

                    trench, and rapidly warned all men in the neighbourhood to put on their gas

                    prompt action and disregard for his personal safety undoubtedly saved several

                    devotion to duty. The difficulty in preventing casualties on such an occasion as
                    this was enhanced by the fact that no alarm could be given by sound, as it was
                    most important that the enemy should not know that gas was installed in our
                    trenches, or that any unusual damage had been done by his bombardment.</p>

                    boxing competition aroused great interest, and on the next evening we returned
                    to the trenches. On the <date when="1916-09-04">4th</date> the usual monotony
                    was relieved by the unusual incident of a deserter coming over to our trenches
                    at 8.30 p.m., a private in the 63rd Regiment of Prussian Infantry, who expressed
                    himself as &quot;fed up&quot; with the war; he was brought to Battalion
                    Headquarters and handed over in due course to the Corps Intelligence branch. The
                    weather generally had been wet for the last few days, and much hard work was
                    expended on draining and revetting trenches.</p>
                <p>On the evening of the <date when="1916-09-08">8th</date>, as a preparatory step
                    for a subsequent raid, it was arranged to blow two gaps in the enemy wire. Two
                    gas pipes 24 feet long and 1½ inches in diameter were filled with ammonal, and
                    fitted with detonators and Nobel lighters, and <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/87/mode/1up" xml:id="p87"/>

                    retire, while he himself struck a match in the darkness, igniting the fuse, and
                    successfully exploding the charge. The parties got back to our trenches without
                    casualty, and the operation was quite successful, two practicable gaps being
                    created in the enemy wire. Meanwhile the Battalion had been relieved earlier in
                    the evening to become Brigade Reserve at <placeName key="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q998666" xml:id="place323">Bienvillers</placeName> for the next six days.</p>
                <p><date when="1916-09-11">September 11th</date> was a holiday on the occasion of
                    the Brigade Sports at <placeName xml:id="place324">La Bezeque</placeName> Farm,
                    which 50 per cent of the Battalion were allowed to attend. Inter-Battalion
                    competitions were arranged for the best turn-out of a limber, a field kitchen,
                    and a pair of pack ponies, various flat races, a mule race, and a steeplechase,
                    but the event which caused the greatest excitement was the Inter-Battalion
                    tug-of-war, which we won after a great struggle. A &quot;knife and
                    fork&quot; tea was provided for the men, and the whole event was a great
                    success. A pleasant day was closed by the whole Battalion carrying gas cylinders
                    from <placeName key="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q998666" xml:id="place325">Bienvillers</placeName> up to the front line
                    trenches, a fatigue which was repeated on the next evening.</p>
                <p>On the <date when="1916-09-14">14th</date> we returned to the trenches for a very
                    quiet but very wet tour, during which the usual trench improvement and
                    strengthening of our wire was carried on. On our relief on the <date when="1916-09-20">20th</date> we proceeded to fresh billets at <placeName key="La Cauchie, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q874115" xml:id="place326">La Cauchie</placeName>, the men being in very good and
                    comfortable huts, and the officers in better billets than usual. Training was
                    conducted on the usual lines, while A Company, who had been selected to carry
                    out a raid in the near future, received special training for the purpose. <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/88/mode/1up" xml:id="p88"/> The Corps race meeting at <placeName xml:id="place327">La Bezeque</placeName> Farm on the afternoon of the <date when="1916-09-25">25th</date> provided most of the officers with a pleasant
                    afternoon's amusement, expensive or profitable as the case might be, dependent
                    on their success or otherwise with a book-making firm, who appeared in the garb
                    and with the paraphernalia usual on an English racecourse. It subsequently
                    transpired that the &quot;book-makers&quot; were two officers of the
                    Battalion, who received later a severe official reprimand which was greatly
                    tempered by the smiling countenance of <rs key="Kemp, Geoffrey Chicheley, Brig-Gen" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/2224676" type="person" xml:id="pers842">our Brigadier</rs>, who was directed to
                    administer it.</p>
                <p>On <date when="1916-09-26">September 26th</date> we began another tour in the
                    trenches, which was more unpleasant than usual partly from bad weather and
                    partly from repeated enemy bombardment with heavy shells and trench mortars. The
                    latter was a serious matter, with the gas cylinders still installed in our front
                    line, a number of them being damaged on the <date when="1916-09-29">29th</date>
                    causing slight gassing of two officers as well as several men. On the <date when="1916-09-30">30th</date> more cylinders were damaged, but on this
                    occasion a fairly strong wind was blowing directly from our trenches to the
                    enemy's, and although we had no casualties, the noise of gongs and bells and a
                    great display of fireworks from the enemy front line was evidence that they must
                    have realised the fact that gas cylinders were in our trenches. On the night of
                        <date when="1916-10-01">October 1st</date>-<date when="1916-10-02">2nd</date> a patrol in front of our right sector discovered a tape laid by the
                    enemy leading from their line to a gap, which had been cut in our wire.
                    Preparations were accordingly made to repel the expected raid, but nothing
                    abnormal occurred. On the <date when="1916-10-02">2nd</date> we were relieved by
                    the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment, and returned to our former billets at
                        <placeName key="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q998666" xml:id="place328">Bienvillers</placeName>. It was decided by the
                    higher authorities that the projected gas attack from our trenches, delayed as
                    it had been for <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/89/mode/1up" xml:id="p89"/> weeks by unfavourable wind and
                    weather, should be abandoned, as the enemy probably had discovered the menace,
                    and for the next three nights carrying parties were detailed to remove the
                    cylinders, and to the great relief of our sister Battalion, the 1/4th
                    Lincolnshire Regiment, and ourselves, the task was completed on the night of
                        <date when="1916-10-04">October 4th</date>. The former Battalion carried out
                    a raid on the night of the <date when="1916-10-05">5th</date> from our trench
                    sector, but found the enemy trenches empty! On the <date when="1916-10-08">8th</date> we again relieved them, and passed a quiet tour, although the
                    village of <placeName key="Berles-au-Bois, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q851809" xml:id="place329">Berles</placeName> immediately in our
                    rear was heavily shelled; on the <date when="1916-10-14">14th</date> we were
                    relieved and went back to Divisional Reserve at <placeName key="La Cauchie, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q874115" xml:id="place330">La
                        Cauchie</placeName>.</p>
                <p>The raid to be carried out by A Company was fixed for <date when="1916-10-18">October 18th</date>, while the Battalion was out of trenches. The Company
                    was carefully trained, and the exact details assiduously practised for the few
                    days before. A description of this raid in some detail may be interesting as
                    more or less typical of raids constantly carried out at this period by other
                    units as well as our own.</p>
                <p>On the afternoon of the <date when="1916-10-18">18th</date> two gaps were cut in
                    the enemy wire by artillery and trench mortar bombardment, and known enemy
                    machine gun emplacements were also bombarded by our howitzers A feint
                    bombardment of two other points in the enemy front line on each flank of the
                    selected points for the raid was also arranged immediately before the hour
                    fixed, 8.30 p.m. At 6.30 p.m. patrols, under 2nd Lieuts. <persName key="Vandyk, Edward, Capt" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/4547413" xml:id="pers232">

                    both practicable, and at the same time laid tapes to them from gaps prepared in
                    our own wire. The Company was organized into two parties, one under the Company

                    <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/90/mode/1up" xml:id="p90"/> for the right gap, each party being
                    sub-divided into forcing, blocking, clearing, parapet, and flanking parties with
                    specially selected leaders. At 8.15 the parties left our trenches, and took up
                    their position in No Man's Land, preparatory to rushing the enemy trenches at
                    the zero hour, 8.30, when an artillery bombardment of the enemy second line, and
                    communication trenches, and various trench junctions was arranged, to continue
                    for 30 minutes. The co-operation with the artillery was very good; punctually at
                    8.30 the artillery bombardment opened, and the parties rushed to the gaps. On
                    the left the raiding party entered the German trench, the blocking party turned
                    to the left and blocked the trench when they were beyond bombing distance of the
                    point of entrance. The forcing party, moving to the right, shot the German
                    sentry at the entrance to a dug-out, and bombed the occupants, passing along to
                    a second dug-out, which was also bombed. Identifications of the German garrison
                    were obtained, the chief object of the raid, showing them to be the 180th
                    Infantry Regiment. The <rs key="Dixon, Oscar, Capt" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/1648136" type="person" xml:id="pers843">

                    heavily bombed, and were running short of bombs, and therefore ordered his party
                    to retire; the retirement was conducted very skilfully and the party returned to
                    our trenches at 8.55 p.m., the only casualty being one man slightly wounded. The

                    of knife-rests heavily wired, and pegged to the ground, extended both ways for a
                    considerable distance. Attempts were made for 15 minutes to remove the

                <p>We returned to trenches on <date when="1916-10-20">October 20th</date>, the tour
                    being marked by very bad weather and increased enemy artillery and trench mortar
                    activity, necessitating incessant work on repair of trenches, and we were

                    the Division was to be withdrawn from the line for a rest. For the next day or
                    two careful inspection of boots, clothing, equipment and transport were made
                    preparatory to the move, and on the <date when="1916-10-30">30th</date> we were

                <p>The prospect of a rest was very welcome; although the trench warfare for the last
                    four months had not been especially strenuous or exciting, yet the strain on all
                    ranks had been considerable, a good many casualties from wounds, gas poisoning,
                    and sickness had been sustained, the weather as a whole had been <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/92/mode/1up" xml:id="p92"/> very bad, necessitating very hard work on
                    upkeep of trenches, and after six months continuous service in the line we
                    looked forward eagerly to a short period of rest outside the shell fire zone, in
                    more or less comfortable billets.</p>

                <p>The march to <placeName key="Halloy, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q989758" xml:id="place334">Halloy</placeName> on the evening of
                        <date when="1916-10-30">October 30th</date> was conducted in silence for the
                    first few miles, as we had no wish to notify our departure to the enemy, but the
                    men were then encouraged to sing, and as each platoon sang a different tune,
                    hymns, sentimental songs, and facetious ditties being chosen impartially in
                    turn, the resulting harmony was interesting. The weather broke during the march,
                    and the Battalion arrived at their billets wet through, but in excellent
                    spirits, at 10.30 p.m. <date when="1916-10-31">Next day</date> was a complete
                    rest, but on <date when="1916-11-01">November 1st</date> the march was continued
                    to <placeName key="Bealcourt, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1090195" xml:id="place335">Bealcourt</placeName> in fine weather: starting
                    at 8 a.m., we had a two-hours' halt at mid-day, when dinners were cooked and
                    eaten by the roadside, and the 14 miles was completed at 4 p.m. On the <date when="1916-11-02">2nd</date> a 10-mile march in Brigade was finished at 3
                    p.m., and the Battalion billeted at <placeName key="Coulonvillers, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q61807" xml:id="place336">Coulonvillers</placeName> for the night; the <date when="1916-11-03">next
                    day</date>'s march of nine miles brought us to <placeName key="Agenvillers, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q30744" xml:id="place337">Argenvillers</placeName>, where excellent billets were available, in which
                    we remained for the next ten days. After such a long spell of trenches marching
                    proved rather a trial to the men, and sore feet were very common, although it
                    was made a point of honour to complete the day's march, and not fall out; the
                    band was a great help during this march.</p>
                <p>We had now reached the area in which the Division was to rest, but the so-called
                    rest was in reality a period of very strenuous training. <date when="1916-11-04">November 4th</date> was devoted to kit inspection and interior economy, <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/94/mode/1up" xml:id="p94"/> but the course of training began <date when="1916-11-05">next day</date> with three hours' close order drill after
                    a Battalion church parade. The details of the training need not be described,
                    but it was practically all training for open warfare, special attention being
                    given to night operations, marching on compass bearing, bayonet fighting, and
                    the practice of the attack by day and night. In addition a strenuous programme
                    of &quot;recreational&quot; training was arranged, each Battalion had
                    its inter-platoon football competition, while an inter-Battalion Divisional
                    competition for a cup presented by the <rs key="Thwaites, William, Maj-Gen" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8019414" type="person" xml:id="pers845">

                    arranged.</p>
                <p>Divisional Headquarters were at <placeName key="Saint-Riquier, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q734988" xml:id="place338">St.

                    opportunity of being within reach of shops and the amenities of civilization, as
                    a day's leave was granted to all in turn. The training programme was a very full
                    one, and it hardly seemed to be realised by the Staffs of Higher Formations that
                    the men did really require some physical rest; the <rs key="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115592757" type="person" xml:id="pers846"><choice>

                    that the men were really being over-worked, and to ask for some relaxation in
                    the hours of work. On <date when="1916-11-11">November 11th</date> we changed
                    our billets, proceeding to <placeName key="Le Plessiel, Drucat, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q109574662" xml:id="place340">La Plessiel</placeName>,
                    a village about three miles nearer to <placeName key="Abbeville, Somme, Picardie, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q28520" xml:id="place341">Abbeville</placeName>, where we found comfortable billets for the remainder of
                    our &quot;rest&quot;. On the <date when="1916-11-12">12th</date> a
                    Brigade church parade was held, a reminiscence of the days of training in

                    drill! The Brigade Boxing competition was held on the <date when="1916-11-18">18th</date> and the Battalion was very successful. On the <date when="1916-11-20">20th</date> the training finished with a very strenuous
                    day's work, the morning being devoted to practising the Battal<pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/95/mode/1up" xml:id="p95"/>ion in attack, with Brigade night operations after dark, the
                    Brigade forming up in mass, marching over open country on a compass bearing, and
                    finally deploying in artillery formation. The Battalion did not get back to
                    billets until nearly 10 p.m., and only a short night's rest was possible, as we
                    left <placeName key="Le Plessiel, Drucat, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q109574662" xml:id="place342">La Plessiel</placeName> at 7.15 a.m. next
                    morning, marching about ten miles to <placeName key="Domqueur, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q70080" xml:id="place343">Domqueur</placeName>, where excellent billets were found, on our way back to

                    we reached <placeName key="Bonnieres, Pas-de-Calais, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q988870" xml:id="place345">Bonnieres</placeName> at 3 p.m. to find

                    where we had rested on our first night out of the trench area. Everyone was wet
                    through, the billets were bad and very crowded, but the depression of spirits
                    produced by these conditions was quickly dispelled by the fine weather and
                    complete rest which the <date when="1916-11-26">next day</date> gave. The
                    <date when="1916-11-27">27th</date> to <date when="1916-11-29">29th</date> were spent in
                    training in the rather limited area available, and the <date when="1916-11-30">30th</date> was devoted to the Divisional Cross-country run. A course of
                    about three miles was marked out, and every officer and man who completed the
                    run in 25 minutes scored one point for his unit. The unit scoring the greatest
                    number of points in proportion to its strength won the competition. Five hundred

                    the run, but owing to an unfortunate mistake on the way to the starting point,
                    some sixty arrived too late to start; however, 167 finished within the shedule

                <p>These two incidents on one night showed that the Germans had apparently been
                    allowed to attain the superiority in the No Man's Land between the lines in this
                    sector, and orders were at once issued by the <rs key="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115592757" type="person" xml:id="pers856"><choice>

                    enjoyed, and prevent the enemy advancing beyond his own wire; these orders were
                    carried out with conspicuous success.</p>
                <p>The remainder of the tour passed uneventfully, and on <date when="1916-12-11">December 11th</date> we were relieved by the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment,
                    and withdrew to billets in <placeName key="Souastre, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q382038" xml:id="place357">Souastre</placeName> as
                    Divisional Reserve. The men were billeted in huts, which were weatherproof, but
                    very cold, as only one small stove was available for 30 men; gridded paths
                    between huts were in good order, but it was essential to keep to the grids as
                    the ground elsewhere was ankle deep in mud, which a snow storm during the night
                    made worse than ever. Bathing, interior economy, route-marching, and company
                    training, as far as bad weather permitted, occupied the next few days. The
                    Divisional Concert Party, the &quot;Whizz-Bangs,&quot; gave their
                    opening performance in <placeName key="Souastre, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q382038" xml:id="place358">Souastre</placeName> on the

                    evening after this date was very highly appreciated. The condition of the
                    trenches to which we returned on the <date when="1916-12-17">17th</date>, in
                    spite of constant repair work, was found to be steadily deteriorating, and
                    constant pumping was necessary in many places to render them tenable, and the
                    mud was 12 to 18 inches deep in the front line. The supply of trench boots was
                    fairly adequate, but the prevention of trench feet was promoted with anxious
                    care all through the winter by taking every precaution. The orders of the <rs key="Sandall, Thomas Edward, Lt-Col" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115592757" type="person" xml:id="pers857"><choice>

                    stretcher bearers' dug out, where his feet were well rubbed with whale oil, dry
                    socks were put on, and boots were changed; by strict adherence to these
                    instructions while in trenches the incidence of trench feet in the Battalion was
                    rendered almost negligible.</p>

                <p>On <date when="1916-12-21">December 21st</date> we were relieved and proceeded to

                    new billets were good, and cellars were available for all, an important asset in
                    view of the fact that bombardments of the area were increasingly frequent.

                    consequently, at the men's request, all Christmas festivities and celebrations

                    sector had been carried out, and on returning to the trenches on the <date when="1916-12-25">25th</date>, only two Companies were distributed in the

                    and in spite of continuous pumping and drainage tended to get worse, as the

                    bombardment of the sector on our left at 3 a.m.— <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/100/mode/1up" xml:id="p100"/> we heard later that the enemy attempted a raid, which was
                    repulsed—caused the Battalion to stand to until 4 a.m. but our front was not
                    attacked; otherwise the tour was quiet, and after another night's heavy rain we

                    </persName> took over the temporary command of the Battalion. Except for
                    occasional enemy bombardment no special incident occurred, and we were relieved
                    on the <date when="1917-01-06">6th</date> and returned to <placeName key="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q998666" xml:id="place365">Bienvillers</placeName> as Brigade Reserve, where a small
                    draft of 85 men joined. The village was somewhat heavily shelled on the evening
                    of the <date when="1917-01-09">9th</date>, but none of our billets were damaged,
                    and the Battalion returned to the trenches on the <date when="1917-01-10">10th</date>. Rain fell nearly every day, and every available man was employed
                    in pumping and clearing trenches, and repairing damage done by enemy shelling,
                    which was troublesome at intervals.</p>
                <p>On the <date when="1917-01-14">14th</date> the Battalion were only too ready to
                    be relieved, and proceed to billets in <placeName key="Souastre, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q382038" xml:id="place366">Souastre</placeName>— the weather cleared for a day or two, permitting some
                    platoon and physical training, but a heavy snowstorm on the <date when="1917-01-17">17th</date> caused everything to be suspended. On <date when="1917-01-18">January 18th</date>, when we returned to the trenches, a
                    redistribution of the Battalion was adopted, two Companies plus one platoon
                    holding the line, one Company (less one platoon) in support in the crypt under
                    the church at <placeName key="Hannescamps, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q910804" xml:id="place367">Hannescamps</placeName>, and one
                    Company with Battalion Headquarters at <placeName key="Foncquevillers, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1031945" xml:id="place368">Fonquevillers</placeName>. Enemy shelling during the tour was very
                    troublesome and did much damage, although causing very few casualties; when the
                    Battalion was relieved on the morning of the <date when="1917-01-22">22nd</date>, one platoon was unable to be relieved till after dark, as the
                    trench was blocked and the parapet destroyed.</p>
                <p>The weather began to improve, and sharp frost succeeded the constant rain to
                    everyone's delight; the next tour in the trenches was comparatively <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/102/mode/1up" xml:id="p102"/> free from hardship, as at least everyone
                    could keep dry if not warm, and on <date when="1917-01-30">Jan. 30th</date> we
                    again returned to <placeName key="Souastre, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q382038" xml:id="place369">Souastre</placeName> as
                    Divisional Reserve, when a careful reorganization of each Company into platoons
                    and sections was carried out. Meanwhile a fresh distribution of front was made,
                    the Brigade sector &quot;side-slipping&quot; to the North, and when we
                    relieved the 1/4th Lincolnshire Regiment on <date when="1917-02-03">February

                    proceeded to <placeName key="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q998666" xml:id="place373">Bienvillers</placeName> on the <date when="1917-02-07">7th</date>, and in the evening received an unexpected
                    warning to be ready to move <date when="1917-02-08">next day</date>, definite
                    orders being received at midnight. Owing to the crowded state of the front area
                    where new second line Territorial Divisions were up for instruction, it was
                    found that one Battalion of the 138th Brigade could be spared to go back for a
                    short rest, and to our great delight we were selected. Accordingly on <date when="1917-02-08">February 8th</date> the Battalion marched by Platoons from
                        <placeName key="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q998666" xml:id="place374">Bienvillers</placeName> to <placeName key="Souastre, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q382038" xml:id="place375">Souastre</placeName>, and thence by Companies through

                    One Company was detailed to work under <rs key="Lotbiniere, Henri Gustave Joly de, Brig-Gen" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q75953399" type="person" xml:id="pers861"><choice>

                    another, while the remainder of the Battalion carried out daily training,
                    especially in trench attack. The only unfortunate incident of our stay at
                        <placeName key="Grenas, Pommera, France" ref="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=50.165662_N_2.445558_E_globe:earth" xml:id="place380">Grenas</placeName> was a fire, which broke out
                    in a billet occupied by D Company about 9 p.m. on <date when="1917-02-10">February 10th</date>, due to a spark from the Company cooker setting alight
                    to the thatch. The fire was subdued by 11 p.m. but considerable damage was done
                    to the property, and some rifles and equipment were destroyed. The <rs key="Schiller, Louis Christian, Capt" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/3923041" type="person" xml:id="pers862">Adjutant</rs> greatly
                    distinguished himself as an amateur fireman on this occasion, and the whole
                    Battalion worked hard to extinguish the conflagration as soon as possible.</p>
                <p>After a pleasant stay of ten days orders were received to return to the trench
                    area on the <date when="1917-02-18">18th</date>, and the Battalion marched to
                        <placeName key="Souastre, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q382038" xml:id="place381">Souastre</placeName> where billets were found
                    for the night, and a draft of 75 men joined <date when="1917-02-18">next
                    day</date>. In the evening the Battalion relieved the 1/4th Lincolnshire
                    Regiment in the old trench sector, which however had been somewhat extended. A
                    frontage of over 2,000 yards was now held by the Battalion by a series of
                    isolated posts, the intervening trenches being blocked and wired in; these posts
                    were manned by 2½ companies, while 1½ companies and Battalion Headquarters were
                    in <placeName key="Hannescamps, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q910804" xml:id="place382">Hannescamp</placeName>. The sector was a very
                    quiet one as a rule, as in places the trenches were nearly 1,000 yards apart and
                    rifle fire was practically absent, but on <date when="1917-02-21">February
                    21st</date>, from 3 to 4 a.m., a very heavy bombardment with shells of all
                    calibres on our right sector was carried out; although the material damage was
                    considerable, only one casualty was caused, and the enemy made no attempt to <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/104/mode/1up" xml:id="p104"/> approach our line. On the <date when="1917-02-22">22nd</date>, a gas shell bombardment caused a few
                    casualties. The weather during the last few days had been very misty, but fine
                    and mild: the thaw, as was to be expected, had again converted the trenches into
                    channels of liquid mud, rendering them absolutely impassable in places, but
                    owing to the mist this was not of so much importance, as it was quite safe even
                    during daylight to move about over the open in our own lines, as the enemy
                    trenches were so far away. On <date when="1917-02-23">February 23rd</date> we
                    were relieved at 8.30 p.m., Battalion Headquarters and two Companies proceeding
                    to <placeName key="Bienvillers-au-Bois, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q998666" xml:id="place383">Bienvillers</placeName>, while two Companies
                    under the <rs key="unknown 2nd in command 1917-02-23" type="unk_person" xml:id="pers863">2nd-in-Command</rs> occupied

                    the new distribution of the Brigade Reserve. This proved to be our last tour of
                    monotonous trench warfare during the winter of 1916-17, as before we returned to
                    the trenches on the <date when="1917-02-27">27th</date>, the great German
                    retreat to the Hindenburg Line had begun, and more interesting and more exciting
                    work than holding a trench line fell to our lot.</p>

                <p>It was common knowledge at the end of <date when="1917-02">February 1917</date>,
                    that the Germans were preparing to retire to their new defensive position, the
                    Hindenburg Line; increased artillery activity, frequent fires and explosions
                    during the night and increased movement by day were all observed from our front
                    trenches, and battalions holding the line were instructed to push patrols boldly
                    forward, and if possible penetrate the old German front line. On becoming
                    Brigade Reserve, we were warned to be ready to move at short notice, and all
                    preparations were made. On the <date when="1917-02-25">25th</date>

                    during the morning, and orders were received warning the Battalion to be ready
                    to move up at once in support, if our patrols were able to occupy any portion of
                    the enemy line in the evening, but this was not found possible, and at 2 a.m.,
                    we were notified accordingly. The <date when="1917-02-26">26th</date> was spent
                    in constant expectation of an order to move, but again we were disappointed.

                    forward at dark, but found the Z trench still strongly held by the enemy, and
                    patrols at 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. returned with the same information.</p>
                <p>On <date when="1917-03-02">March 2nd</date> the weather was very misty and the
                    enemy line invisible, but patrols reported the position unchanged. In the

                    Division appeared likely in the immediate future, a course of training was
                    arranged especially in open warfare, night marching on compass bearing, trench

                <p>Later in the evening we were ordered to push forward, one Company to hold the

                    continued to hold the line, while the 58th Division, on our left, advanced
                    across our front to <placeName key="Boiry-Becquerelle, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q851819" xml:id="place413">Boiry</placeName> and

                    squeezing us out of the front line; the position was maintained, however, until

                    Fosse 3, the assaulting Battalions being the 1/4th Lincolnshire and the 1/5th
                    Leicestershire Regiments with the 1/4th Leicestershire as &quot;Moppers

                    officer 80 other ranks. Owing to the shortage of officers, none could be left
                    behind. The two assaulting companies were in position by 2 p.m., C Company in
                    assembly trenches near the left of the assaulting companies, while D Company
                    remained in cellars until wanted. Zero hour was 2.30 p.m. and the barrage
                    opened, and the assaulting companies advanced in two waves punctually. At Zero
                    plus 6 minutes the enemy put down a barrage on our assembly trenches, especially
                    on the left, but this did not interfere with our advance. The right Company got
                    into the trenches without difficulty or casualties, many of the enemy were
                    killed and some 30 taken prisoners, others being driven towards the Canadians on

                    position, but could make no impression either in front or flanks, and as the
                    rifle and machine gun fire was heavy, <persName key="Disney, Sydney Cecil William, Maj" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/1642649" xml:id="pers361">

                    </persName> ordered the line to be dug in, and the position already gained to be
                    consolidated. About 4.15 a.m. a patrol was sent out to try and gain touch with
                    the 137th Brigade on the left, but they were heavily fired on, and no sign of
                    our troops could be found, so a defensive flank was formed. About 5 a.m. the
                    enemy appeared in strength about the houses in front, apparently intending to
                    counter-attack, but were dispersed by our rifle and Lewis gun fire. Meanwhile,
                    digging in had been carried on under heavy shell and machine gun fire all the
                    time, and this was continued throughout the day. At 6.30 a.m., three patrols

                    line had been gained on the right and almost gained on the left, the enemy would
                    retire if pressed. These patrols got forward some distance among the houses, but
                    were met by heavy fire and could make no further progress. Another patrol about
                    10 a.m. gained touch with the 137th Brigade on the left, but could get no
                    definite information as to their position, and for several hours no further
                    movement could be made.</p>

                    fled, but he captured several belts of ammunition. Shortly afterwards he saw <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/133/mode/1up" xml:id="p133"/> the enemy about 50 strong massing on his
                    flank; although his party was only 10 or 12 strong, he at once attacked, opening
                    fire with Lewis guns and rifles; several of the enemy were seen to fall and the
                    remainder got into the houses. For half-an-hour the party remained in a forward

                <p>About 3.30 p.m. the enemy shelling increased to a great intensity on the front of
                        <placeName xml:id="place511">Cité de Moulin</placeName>, much movement was
                    observed, and apparently another counter attack was contemplated; however, rifle
                    and Lewis gun fire was kept up steadily, and nothing occurred. When information
                    was received that the enemy was moving in strength on our left flank, the
                    reserve (C) Company were sent up to strengthen it. About 6 p.m., owing to heavy
                    shelling and the fact that no cover was available, our advanced posts were
                    withdrawn in order to make a continuous line. At 9 p.m. orders were received to
                    attack the houses occupied by the enemy, without artillery support, at 10 p.m.,
                    and bombing and bayonet parties advanced up to the houses, but they were found
                    occupied in strength, and no progress could be made. Another attempt was made at
                    11 p.m. but by this time the enemy had established a regular line close to our
                    front, and nothing could be done.</p>
                <p>The right Company (D) suffered some casualties in the assembly trenches, and on
                    advancing met with some opposition from a machine gun, which was put out of
                    action by our Lewis guns, and they went forward towards their objective, but the
                    enemy held an organised position on a road in front in considerable strength, so
                        <persName key="Squire, Edwin Ross, Capt" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/4216907" xml:id="pers365">

                    </persName> decided to hold the line gained. At 3 a.m. the enemy opened <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/134/mode/1up" xml:id="p134"/> fire with rifle grenades and bombs, and
                    shortly afterwards left his position and counter-attacked. He was met by rifle
                    and Lewis gun fire, and apparently suffered considerable loss as his line
                    disappeared and bombing ceased. As touch at this time was lost with both flanks,
                    the company withdrew a short distance, and took up a fresh defensive line, when
                    the enemy again advanced in considerable strength and in good order for a second
                    counter-attack, which was again dispersed by our rifle and Lewis gun fire. The
                    Company then dug in under heavy fire and attempted to gain touch with both
                    flanks, which was satisfactorily accomplished. <persName key="Fevre, Frank Edward Bayliss Le, 2nd Lt" xml:id="pers366"><roleName type="military">Second Lieut.</roleName>

                    9.15 p.m. the left flank of the right company, which had got further forward
                    than the left company, was slightly withdrawn to link up in one line with the
                    latter. When orders were received at 10 p.m. to mop up the houses in front this
                    change in position was taking place, bombs and ammunition were running short,
                    casualties had been heavy and the enemy was found to be holding the houses

                     left rear party, and 100 Other Ranks. The assembly in Boyeau 78 was carried out without a hitch, and
                    was evidently not noticed by the enemy as not a shot was fired. The barrage
                    started punctually, and the men started off well, the advance being made in
                    three lines at 30 yards distance, the objective being the enemy's third line.
                    The German wire had been fairly well cut, but the enemy had made efforts to mend
                    it with barbed concertina wire in places, and the men had to bunch to get
                    through. However, it was passed everywhere without much difficulty, and there
                    were no casualties previous to entering the front line trench. The enemy barrage
                    came down quickly in No Man's Land behind the raiding party at Zero plus two
                    minutes, and later increased in intensity—the preliminary wire cutting had
                    probably put the enemy on his guard, and he was expecting an attack, as the
                    first two lines of trenches were found unoccupied, but the third line was
                    strongly held, and heavy rifle and machine gun fire was opened on the raiding
                    party. An attempt was made to advance on this trench under cover of rifle and
                    Lewis gun fire, but it was found to be strongly wired, <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/141/mode/1up" xml:id="p141"/> and some of our own shells were falling short, so the party

                    firing a Stokes Mortar. He noticed that the lever of one of the Stokes bombs had
                    been knocked off, thereby causing the fuse to burn, and realised that in 12
                    seconds the bomb would explode. He placed it in the mortar with the intention of
                    firing it at the enemy but the cartridge misfired, and the bomb remained in the
                    mortar with the fuse burning. In order to avoid an explosion, which would have
                    wrecked the mortar, endangered the lives of other men, and probably destroyed

                    trenches became impassable and food had to be conveyed to the front line at

                    rain fell all <date when="1918-01-16">next day</date>. On the <date when="1918-01-17">17th</date>, as it was found impossible with the men
                    available to clear the trenches, two companies of our Pioneer <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/155/mode/1up" xml:id="p155"/> Battalion, the 1st Monmouthshire Regiment, were sent to our
                    assistance. The Division was now being withdrawn from the line for a time, being
                    relieved by the 11th Division, and we were expecting to be relieved in the
                    trenches by the 6th York and Lancaster Regiment in a few day's time. Owing to
                    the bad weather, however, and the awful condition of the trenches our tour was
                    shortened, and the Battalion were only too pleased to be relieved on the night
                    of <date when="1918-01-17">January 17th</date> by the 1/4th Lincolnshire

                    by no means a quiet one, our casualties had been numerous, the weather for the
                    past few weeks atrocious, the work very heavy, and the strain on the health of
                    the men severe.</p>

                <p>The reorganization of the British Army, with the reduction of a Brigade from four

                    the Battalion was ordered to stand to during the night owing to an expected

                    hour's notice to move, but were not called upon. About <date when="1918-04-21">April 21st</date> a virulent epidemic of influenza attacked the Battalion,
                    and the whole Division, and for the next few days the number of sick removed to
                    hospital was very large, from 20 to 40 daily, which reduced our fighting
                    strength to such low numbers, that the efficiency of the Battalion was very
                    seriously impaired. The whole Division suffered in the same way, and its <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/159/mode/1up" xml:id="p159"/> numbers for a long period were terribly below

                    as although the trenches were fairly continuous they were narrow and shallow,
                    and no movement was possible by day. Early next morning a German of the 12th

                    front line, and several farms <choice>

                    </choice> of the Rue Du Bois. Platoons were at once sent forward to occupy these
                    positions, and push on to the Rue Du Bois, which had been laid down as the first
                    objective of our advance. On the left B Company encountered some opposition from
                    machine guns and snipers during the day, but were able to occupy their allotted
                    positions in the evening and gain touch with the Battalion on their left. A
                    Company on the right were held up, as the Battalion on our right did not move
                    until midnight of <date when="1918-08-20">August 20th</date>-<date when="1918-08-21">21st</date>. They were heavily gas-shelled, and suffered a
                    considerable number of casualties, so C Company were sent up with orders to
                    advance through them and push on at once to Rue du Bois, which they successfully
                    carried out, encountering little opposition so that by 5 a.m. on <date when="1918-08-21">August 21st</date> the whole Battalion were on their line,
                    and in touch with the Battalions on both flanks from 200 to 500 yards from the
                    enemy's advanced positions. During the day the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment
                    took over the whole Brigade front, and on relief our companies were distributed

                    forward in accordance with the scheme of operations for the 46th Division to
                    conform with the movement of the 19th Division, which attacked on our left. The
                    advance of the left Company was held up by enemy strong points, and very little
                    progress was made, as the Division on our right was not moving forward. Patrols
                    attempted to drive the enemy out on the left during the day, and failed, and an
                    inter-company relief was arranged at dark, B and C Companies advancing and
                    passing through A and D to establish a line if possible along Princes Road. As
                    soon as D Company on the left passed through the front line they were met by
                    rifle and machine gun fire from Rum Post and Path Post, and checked. The left

                    enemy garrison between 20 and 30 fled, leaving the machine gun in our hands. The
                    platoon then pushed forward, capturing four prisoners and clearing snipers out
                    of the houses in Rue du Bois. The capture of this strong point enabled the whole
                    line to advance, although there was some <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/172/mode/1up" xml:id="p172"/>
                    resistance on the right flank from a machine gun, which was overcome and

                    advanced, and occupied Indian Village, while the Battalion on our left had also
                    moved forward, and occupied posts in advance of our left flank, so that our line

                <p>In accordance with orders our line was slightly withdrawn to the line Haystack
                    Post-Path Post in order to form a good jumping off line for the 1/5th
                    Leicestershire Regiment, who were to attack at dawn on the <date when="1918-09-04">4th</date>, their objective being the old British front
                    line. The attack was a complete success, the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment
                    passing through our line, and gaining their objective, and the 139th Brigade on
                    our left and the 55th Division on our right were equally successful. As soon as
                    the assaulting <corr>troops</corr> had passed through our line the Battalion, in
                    accordance with Brigade orders, issued the previous evening, was reorganised,
                    and followed the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment, acting as &quot;moppers
                    up&quot; and keeping in close touch. The enemy resistance was slight and his
                    artillery very little in evidence, and our casualties during the day were nil.
                    During <date when="1918-09-04">September 4th</date> and <date when="1918-09-05">5th</date> we maintained our position, the enemy shelling the forward area
                    with light, and the rear position with heavy, shells, but again we suffered no
                    casualties.</p>

                    which we occupied till <date when="1918-09-11">September <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/173/mode/1up" xml:id="p173"/> 11th</date>, the Companies after the first day, which as
                    usual was devoted to cleaning and interior economy, being at the disposal of the
                    Company Commanders for training. On the afternoon of the <date when="1918-09-11">11th</date> all preparations were completed for a movement by train, and
                    during the night the move was carried out without any difficulty, our

                    suffered a good deal from shell fire, good billets, to our surprise and
                    satisfaction, were available. The weather which had been fine for the last
                    fortnight now broke, and the next few days were wet or showery. Companies were
                    at the disposal of Company Commanders in the morning, and in the afternoons
                    inter-platoon football and tug-of-war competitions were held, the finals being
                    on <date when="1918-09-17">September 17th</date>, when No. 16 won the football,
                    and No. 7 the tug-of-war. On two days the attack with ball ammunition was
                    practised by platoons, in conjunction with Stokes trench mortars.</p>
                <p>This short rest ended on <date when="1918-09-19">September 19th</date>, when the
                    Battalion left <placeName key="Ribemont-sur-Ancre, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q626976" xml:id="place641">Ribemont</placeName> by 'bus shortly

                    which took place on <date when="1918-09-29">September 29th</date>. This
                    operation was a magnificent success, and was recognised to be one of the most
                    brilliant feats of arms performed during the war. It is only possible in this
                    history to record the part played by the Battalion, but the story of the

                    </choice> direction under a creeping barrage and the operation was quite
                    successful, although all the objectives were not taken. Two enemy posts were
                    captured by our right company on the left flank of the 1/5th Leicestershire
                    Regiment, and the line captured was consolidated; 150 prisoners were taken.
                    During the <date when="1918-09-25">25th</date> our forward positions were
                    somewhat heavily shelled, and an inter-company relief was effected in the
                    evening. The trench line was held <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/175/mode/1up" xml:id="p175"/> until the
                    evening of the <date when="1918-09-27">27th</date>, when the Battalion was
                    relieved by the 1/6th South Staffordshire Regiment, and moved back to reserve
                    trenches near <placeName key="Le Verguier, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q870040" xml:id="place646">Le Vergier</placeName>, where we
                    rested during the <date when="1918-09-28">28th</date>.</p>
                <p>No attempt will be made to describe the operations of the 46th Division as a
                    whole, but a general idea of the scheme is necessary in order to understand the
                    part played by the Battalion. The 46th Division was ordered to cross the St.
                    Quintin canal, capture the Hindenburg line, and advance to positions beyond and
                    consolidate them for defence, after which the 32nd Division would pass through
                    the line, and continue the attack. The 30th American Division on the left were
                    to attack simultaneously about 1,000 yards to north, and after crossing the
                    Canal turn south, and gain touch with the 46th Division, and advance with them.
                    The 137th Brigade on a three Battalion front led the Divisional attack, followed
                    by the 138th and 139th Brigades, each on a one Battalion front, the 138th
                    Brigade on the left, and the 139th Brigade on the right. The 1/4th
                    Leicestershire Regiment was the leading Battalion of the 138th Brigade, followed
                    by the 1/5th Lincolnshire, and 1/5th Leicestershire Regiments. As soon as the
                    137th Brigade had crossed the Canal, and captured their objective, the 138th
                    Brigade Battalions were to continue the advance by the leap-frog method, the
                    1/4th Leicestershire having gained their objective would consolidate it for
                    defence, the 1/5th Lincolnshire passing through this line would capture their
                    objective, the village of <placeName key="Magny-la-Fosse, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q765556" xml:id="place647">Magny La

                <p>At 3 a.m. on <date when="1918-09-29">September 29th</date> the Battalion left
                        <placeName key="Le Verguier, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q870040" xml:id="place648">Le Vergier</placeName> to take up assembly
                    positions on Ascension Ridge. Zero hour was 5.30 a.m., when the 137th Brigade
                    advanced. At 8.45 a.m. the Battalion moved forward to jumping off positions in
                    the Hindenburg system west of the Canal. There was a dense fog, nothing whatever
                    could be seen, and the advance had to be made on a compass bearing, but was
                    successfully accomplished, the exact positions were attained, and the Battalion
                    formed up with three Companies, B, A and D, from right to left in the front
                    line, with C Company in support. The attack of the 137th Brigade had been a
                    complete success, and at 10.30 a.m. the Battalion moved forward in artillery
                    formation to the bridge across the Canal, resuming this formation and then
                    extending into open formation as we approached the line which by 12 noon had
                    been occupied by the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment at the west end of <placeName key="Magny-la-Fosse, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q765556" xml:id="place649">Magny La Fosse</placeName>, in touch with the Americans on
                    our left and the 139th Brigade on our right. At 12.30 p.m. the Battalion
                    advanced from this line under a creeping barrage which advanced 100 yards in 4
                    minutes, to <placeName key="Magny-la-Fosse, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q765556" xml:id="place650">Magny La Fosse</placeName> village,
                    flanking troops simultaneously advancing on our right and left. At this point,
                    where the barrage was picked up, four tanks who were co-operating in the attack,
                    moved forward with the Battalion. The right Company followed its tank, which
                    moved forward along a trench system, successfully cleared the trench and ground
                    and reached its objective without very much opposition. The centre Company sent
                    two platoons to encircle the village on the south side, while two platoons moved
                    through the village itself. The left Company moved forward and reached its
                    objective without much opposition.</p>

                    The large number of prisoners taken caused some delay in the advance, so the
                    support Company was pushed forward, in order to keep up with the barrage,
                    cleared the east end of the village and occupied the objective, which was
                    reached at 1.20 p.m. At 1.50 p.m. the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment passed
                    through our line towards their objective, about 1,000 yards east, which they
                    successfully occupied, and the Divisional objective was thus obtained.</p>
                <p>The freedom with which the enemy surrendered was very noticeable, and the
                    Battalion alone captured 400 prisoners, including several officers, and an
                    artillery group commander, 7 field guns, and 20 machine guns. Our casualties

                <p>At 6.30 p.m. the Battalion took over the whole Brigade frontage; C Company

                    pushed well forward. At 8.30 p.m. a readjustment of frontage was ordered, the

                    m. our patrols reported Landricourt Wood clear of the enemy, and this
                    information was passed to the French, who subsequently attacked the Bois
                    D'Etaves from that direction. In co-operation with this advance our line was
                    pushed forward, and at 9 a.m. on <date when="1918-10-10">October 10th</date> was

                    500 to 1, 000 yards in advance. At 12.30 p.m., the 1/4th Leicestershire Regiment
                    passed through our line, and continued the advance, the Battalion thus coming
                    into support. At 5.30 p.m. the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment passed through,
                    thus bringing the Battalion into reserve and our dispositions remained unchanged
                    during the night. There was little or no opposition to the advance, although
                    desultory enemy shelling caused a few casualties. At 7 a.m. on <date when="1918-10-11">October 11th</date> the Battalion was relieved by the

                <p>Soon after midnight on <date when="1918-11-06">November 6th</date>-<date when="1918-11-07">7th</date>, our patrols passed through the outposts of the

                    River, to reconnoitre the river banks and find a means of crossing. It was found

                    before dawn and get into position on the east side of the river, ready to move
                    forward at dawn. At 5 a.m. on <date when="1918-11-07">November 7th</date> the
                    138th Brigade took over the whole Divisional front, passing through the 137th
                    and 139th Brigade out-posts, the 1/5th Leicestershire Regiment on the right, the
                    1/5th Lincolnshire on the left, and the 1/4th Leicestershire in support. At 4.30
                    a.m. a patrol was sent forward to the foot bridge to reconnoitre for any signs
                    of the enemy, and had instructions to report to Battalion Headquarters as soon
                    as the companies had crossed and were in position on the further bank. When <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/190/mode/1up" xml:id="p190"/> the patrol arrived at the site of the bridge
                    they found to their dismay that the river had risen in flood, and had washed
                    away the foot bridge leaving no means whatever of crossing, but there were no
                    signs of the enemy, and civilians who appeared on the east bank stated that the
                    Germans had left at 3 a.m. When the companies reached the river bank, A Company
                    on the left rapidly constructed a rough temporary bridge by throwing carts into
                    the river, and putting planks and ladders on them, the French civilian
                    inhabitants doing the same from the opposite bank. The bridge was not very safe
                    but A Company managed to cross without accidents and were very shortly in
                    position on the east bank, where they were rapturously greeted by the
                    inhabitants. On the right B and C Companies were less fortunate in finding carts
                    and other material for an improvised bridge, so trees were felled and placed
                    across. There was great difficulty owing to the strength of the current in
                    getting the trees into position, and <persName key="Dunn, Robin Gaspar, Capt (d 1919)" ref="https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/369654/" xml:id="pers561">

                    river, and the advance began, C and D Companies in front with A and B in support
                    and the first objective was reached without any opposition. As soon as touch was
                    established on either flank the advance was resumed to the second objective,
                    which was reached at mid-day. Patrols were sent forward and reported that the
                    high ground in front was strongly held. Our line tried to advance, but the enemy
                    line was strongly held <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/191/mode/1up" xml:id="p191"/> by numerous machine
                    gun posts, which were cleverly placed commanding the valley and low ground, and
                    it was found impossible to take the position without artillery support.
                    Accordingly our line was slightly withdrawn, and an outpost position taken up
                    for the night, and dug in, A, B and C Companies in the line, with D in support.
                    Our casualties were 2 officers, <persName key="Dunn, Robin Gaspar, Capt (d 1919)" ref="https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/369654/" xml:id="pers564">

                    patrols, who reported at dawn on the <date when="1918-11-08">8th</date> that the
                    enemy were still holding the same line. At 11 a.m. a light artillery barrage was
                    put down on the enemy position, but we only had a few field guns across the
                    river, and the barrage was so weak that it had little or no effect, and when our
                    troops tried to advance, they were again met by heavy machine gun fire, and also
                    by some trench mortar bombs. A Company however got in contact with two or three
                    enemy posts and inflicted casualties. <persName key="Griffiths, William B, 40615" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/1479825" xml:id="pers566"><roleName type="military">Lance-Corporal</roleName>

                <p>When it was found that the Germans intended to hold on to the strong position
                    they occupied in our front, it was decided to wait until more guns could be got
                    across the river, and then make an attack in force; the barrage and attack was
                    fixed for 4 p.m. Meanwhile the 32nd Division on our left were at 1 p.m.
                    advancing in close formation, and it was also reported that the French on our
                    right were also advancing; in both cases the enemy had retired in front of them,
                    but continued to hold on to the position on our front until 1.30 p.m., when he
                    evacuated it. Our troops followed up closely, but met with no further
                    opposition, and the final objective for the day was reached at 6 p.m. An outpost
                    line was taken up and orders were received that the Brigade would be relieved by
                    the 137th Brigade at dawn, but before the relief was effected our Brigade was

                <p>The Battalion was stationed at <placeName key="Bousies, France" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q632387" xml:id="place718">Bousies</placeName>
                    from <date when="1918-11-14">November 14th, 1918</date>, to <date when="1919-02-24">February 24th, 1919</date>, and was occupied during that
                    period chiefly in salvage work, filling in of trenches, and a certain amount of
                    Company training, but the details of a somewhat weary time of waiting are of no
                    interest. On <date when="1918-11-26">November 26th</date>, the educational
                    classes, which occupied one hour a day, were started. Ceremonial guard-mounting
                    was established for Battalion and Brigade guards, each Battalion finding the
                    Brigade duties in turn. On <date when="1918-11-30">November 30th</date> the
                    King's and Regimental Colours, brought from England by Lieuts. <persName key="Stanley, Lt" xml:id="pers569">

                        <surname>Mansfield</surname></persName>, were received with due ceremony. Recreational training was the rule
                    in the afternoons, and as many forms of entertainment as possible were arranged
                    for the evenings. The Divisional Concert Party, the Whizz-Bangs, gave their
                    entertainment each night for a week at intervals, various lectures were given,
                    boxing competitions held, and every endeavour was made to provide amusement and
                    recreation for the men.</p>
                <p>Christmas was spent in the usual fashion, excellent Company dinners were
                    provided, and the Christmas Comforts Fund again contributed largely to the
                    enjoyment of all ranks.</p>
                <p>On <date when="1919-01-01">January 1st, 1919</date>, the preparations for

                    censorship of letters was abolished. Salvage work and the filling in of <pb facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/195/mode/1up" xml:id="p195"/> trenches continued, with Platoon and
                    Company-training. A Platoon competition in drill and general training was held
                    during the <date when="1919-01">month</date>, and after very keen competition

                    Battalion of the Lincolnshire Regiment into being, with all the traditions of
                    the old Battalion, and there is no doubt that it will worthily maintain those

                    <pb xml:id="p200" facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/200/mode/1up" /> was that <placeName xml:id="pl17t" key="Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q24306292">Barton</placeName> was allotted to <placeName xml:id="pl18t" key="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q179406">Grimsby</placeName> until such time as the Machine Gun Platoon should be formed. <placeName xml:id="pl19t" key="Brigg, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2058702">Brigg</placeName>, having no Drill Hall, was abolished and <placeName xml:id="pl20t" key="Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q288082">Gainsborough</placeName> and <placeName xml:id="pl21t" key="Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q913386">Scunthorpe</placeName> each allotted a complete Company.

                <p>The <rs>Commanding Officer</rs> and <rs>Adjutant</rs> paid several visits to the detachment but did not remain throughout the period as all Drill Halls were kept open for recruiting purposes.

                <p>C Company thus held the proud position of easily being the first Company to raise its full establishment, and as recruits continued to present themselves the Commanding Officer decided to raise a proportion of the Headquarter Unit there in order not to stop intending recruits joining.
                </p>
                <p>Consequently band, drums, signallers, transport and pioneers were allotted to this detachment in addition to the Company.
                </p>
                <p>The following officers had been gazetted during the above period:
                </p>
                <p><persName xml:id="ps24t" key="Hadfield, James Henry, Maj" ref="https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/1510593"><roleName type="military">Major</roleName> <forename full="init">J</forename>. <forename full="init">H</forename>. <surname>Hadfield</surname></persName>, who had served continuously in the Battalion since 1900, and who though suffering from the effects of wounds received in action was specially re-appointed to assist in the period of reconstruction.
                </p>
                <p>The narrative has now been brought up to the commencement of April, 1921, and notices were appearing in orders regarding the Annual Training at <placeName xml:id="pl31t" key="Skegness, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q977991">Skegness</placeName> when an event occurred which had far reaching consequences on the Battalion, as on the country in general; but whereas in the latter case these consequences were serious, in the former they were fraught with good results.
                </p>
                <p>The national coal strike is referred to.
                    <pb xml:id="p202" facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/202/mode/1up" /> Though this is not a history of the Defence Force Battalion, its affairs are so intimately connected with that of the Battalion proper, and had such far reaching results on it that some reference is necessary.
                </p>
                <p>On <date when="1921-04-08">April 8th, 1921</date>, the <rs>Commanding Officer</rs> and <rs>Adjutant</rs> were summoned to the Brigade Headquarters at <placeName xml:id="pl32t" key="Lincoln, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q180057">Lincoln</placeName> by telephone and there was a conference on arrangements to be made should it be necessary to raise a Citizen Force for the protection of the vital needs of the Country.
                </p>
                <p>On their way back to <placeName xml:id="pl33t" key="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q179406">Grimsby</placeName> in an evening paper bought at <placeName xml:id="pl34t" key="Retford, Nottinghamshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2462685">Retford</placeName>, they saw that the necessity had actually arisen, and the following morning's papers had full details of the call to the nation.
                </p>
                <p>Thereafter began a period of work to which the mobilization of August, 1914, was child's play.
                </p>
                <p>Then a carefully prepared scheme was available to work on, and an existing Battalion had only to be mobilized. Now not only had a new Battalion to be raised, armed, clothed and equipped; for the Territorial Battalion was not mobilized; but all arrangements had to be improvised as the work progressed and the Battalion grew in numbers.
                </p>
                <p>Battalion Headquarters were opened at the <placeName xml:id="pl35t" key="Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q179406">Grimsby</placeName> Drill Hall; recruiting being simultaneously carried out at all the Company headquarters and outstations.
                </p>
                <p>The response was excellent and on <date when="1921-04-18">April 18th, 1921</date>, on which date recruiting was stopped, the strength of the 5th Lincolnshire Regiment Defence Force was 28 officers and 513 other ranks.
                </p>
                <p>Had recruiting not been stopped, the Battalion would have been at full peace strength in another 24 hours.
                </p>
                <p>The following officers of the Territorial Battalion took Commissions in the Defence Force Battalion:

                </p>
                <p>The Battalion was concentrated at the old Royal Naval Air Force station at <placeName xml:id="pl36t" key="North Killingholme, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1929232">Killingholme</placeName> on <date when="1921-04-25">April 25th</date> and remained there until the Defence Force was dispersed on <date when="1921-07-07">July 7th, 1921</date>, during which period it had been inspected by the <rs><choice><abbr>G.O.C.</abbr><expan>General Officer Commanding</expan></choice> 46th North Midland Division</rs> and <rs>Brigade Commander, Lincoln and Leicester Brigade</rs>, receiving most complimentary reports in each case.
                </p>
                <p>The result of this embodiment of a Battalion based on the Drill Halls and organization of the Territorial Battalion and bearing practically the same designation was most marked.
                </p>
                <p>In one year only 220 men had been raised; chiefly owing to the apathy that existed after the war. Men that had served through it had had enough soldiering whilst only the fringe had been touched in the case of the younger men who had been under military age at the time of the armistice.
                </p>
                <p>Of these 220 men over one-half came from one station.
                </p>
                <p>The rush of recruits for the Defence Force, at a time when there was every prospect of serious work in front of it at very short notice, showed that the old spirit, that brought men flocking to the Colours
                    <pb xml:id="p204" facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/204/mode/1up" /> in 1914, was not dead; whilst the numbers at each Company Headquarters before the concentration at <placeName xml:id="pl37t" key="North Killingholme, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1929232">Killingholme</placeName>, called the attention of local inhabitants of military age to the fact that a Battalion did exist in their midst, though they had, apparently been almost unaware of the fact.
                </p>
                <p>During the embodiment period officers had taken the opportunity to bring before their men the advantages of the Territorial Army and to sow the seed that should bring forth the crop at the appointed time.
                </p>
                <p>Directly the orders for the dispersal of the Defence Force were received, recruiting for the Territorial Battalion was opened and the results were more than gratifying.
                </p>
                <p>Attestations had been prepared beforehand so that in many cases all that remained to do was to swear the men in. This could not be done till the day of their discharge from the Defence Force.
                </p>
                <p>Fresh recruits, who had not served in the Defence Force, also commenced to present themselves for enlistment right up till the departure of the Territorial Battalion for its Annual Training at <placeName xml:id="pl38t" key="Skegness, Lincolnshire, England" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q977991">Skegness</placeName> on <date when="1921-07-27">July 27th</date>.
                </p>
                <p>Similarly as regards officers.
                </p>
                <p>The old officers of the Battalion who had not been reappointed until the Defence Force mobilization, but rejoined at this period were:

                </p>
                <p>The result of all the above is best summed up by
                    giving the strength of the Battalion as at <date when="1921-08-01">August
                    1st, 1921</date>.
                    
                </p>
                <p>Officers 18, other ranks 425.
                    A gain of 205 men in four months.
                    The final figures that will be quoted as of interest
                    are those showing strength and distribution of the
                    Battalion on April 1st, 1922, two years after the
                    opening of recruiting and one year after the mobilization of the Defence Force.

                <p>This appears to be the point at which an account of the reorganization may be brought to a close.
                </p>
                <p>Much has been accomplished in two years, much remains to be done, but it may be fairly claimed that the corner has been turned and the goal is in view.
                </p>
                <p>The reorganization cannot be said to be complete till the full peace establishment of 637 is reached; but with the progression of recruiting steadily this may be looked for in the not distant future; and what must at all times be borne in mind by the
                    <pb xml:id="p206" facs="https://archive.org/details/sandall5thlincs/page/206/mode/1up" /> older members of the Battalion, who saw service in the great war, is that their allotted span of soldiering is drawing to a close and it is to the younger generation that one must look to carry on those great traditions that have been built up in the past by their predecessors in the 5th Battalion the Lincolnshire Regiment.
                </p>
                <p>To members of the young generation must they hold out every encouragement and inducement to join; and whom, having joined, must they endeavour to assist by imparting such knowledge as they themselves have gained in long years of service to King and Country.
